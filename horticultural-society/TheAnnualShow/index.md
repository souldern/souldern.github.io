# The Annual Show

It is with great regret that the Souldern Horticultural Society announces the cancellation of this year’s annual flower & produce show.

SHS Chairperson Carol Gray said:

> 'We know how important this event is to the village and it’s a great pity that we have to cancel at a time when local interest in gardening is so strong. However, having consulted with a range of people involved with the organisation of the show, we feel that it would be extremely unwise to proceed when Coronavirus still poses such a threat.
>
> 'Our aim now is to channel the enthusiasm for vegetable and flower growing into making our 2021 event a bumper show.’
>
> The Royal Horticultural Society, to which the Souldern Horticultural Society is affiliated, has cancelled all its 2020 events.

***********

The show is usually held in August each year and is an opportunity for members and non-members to show their produce.

In addition to classes for vegetables, fruit and flowers, there are also classes for home produce for adults and crafts for children.

Details of how to enter, schedule of classes, etc., can be seen using the menu on the left.
The complete schedule is available as a document that you can download: see below.

## Fruits of their labours rewarded

Held in the village hall on Saturday 17 August 2019, the Souldern Horticultural Society flower & produce annual show highlighted the skills and dedication of those who toil in the village's gardens, allotments and kitchens. Beautifully proportioned vegetables and fruit, breathtaking flower arrangements together with mouthwatering cakes, pastries, jams and preserves made the Souldern village hall a feast for the senses. Equally impressive were the themed craft items created by local children. Innovation and imagination are alive in Souldern.

The prize winners were (clockwise from left) Helen Blunt, Susan Jones, Bill Wright, Carol Gray, Sophia Large and Ben Pheasant.

Society Chairperson Carol Gray said, 

> 'Our annual show is an important event, not just for the Horticultural Society but for the village at large. We believe that there are compelling ecological and financial reasons for growing your own produce. It's also very satisfying to see your fruit and veg grow, even if you don't enter them in competitions. We have a panel of experts who will happily give advice and guidance on how to get started. If you're thinking of becoming a grower, please don't hesitate to call me on 01869 345965.'

And you're never too young to start...
