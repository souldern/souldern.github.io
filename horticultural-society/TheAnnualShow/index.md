# The Annual Show

The show is usually held in August each year and is an opportunity for members and non-members to show their produce.

In addition to classes for vegetables, fruit and flowers, there are also classes for home produce for adults and crafts for children.

Details of how to enter, schedule of classes, etc., can be seen using the links below.
The complete schedule is available as a document that you can download: see below.


Society Chairperson Carol Gray said, 

> 'Our annual show is an important event, not just for the Horticultural Society but for the village at large. We believe that there are compelling ecological and financial reasons for growing your own produce. It's also very satisfying to see your fruit and veg grow, even if you don't enter them in competitions. We have a panel of experts who will happily give advice and guidance on how to get started. If you're thinking of becoming a grower, please don't hesitate to call me on 01869 345965.'

And you're never too young to start...
