# Show introduction:

Souldern Horticultural Society holds an Annual Show where residents of Souldern may exhibit home grown produce, flowers and cookery. 

Exhibitors must be residents of Souldern or grow produce on land in Souldern, but do not have to belong to the Society.  However, it should be noted that the entry fees are doubled for non-members and they are not entitled to win the Challenge Cups. 

Membership of the Society is only Â£3 per person per year and there are other benefits to be gained such as discount on seed orders.  To join, please contact the Chairperson, Carol Gray. 

There are separate classes for children to enter and there is no entry fee for these. 
There are two categories: under 8 years and 8-15 years.  Children who are temporarily resident at the time of the show may also enter these classes.  If any child wishes to enter an adult class, then they must pay the appropriate entry fee.  If they wish to compete for a Challenge Cup, or the Diamond Jubilee Cup, then they must become a Society member. 

Finally, the show is not just for the experts, it is for all the people of Souldern and it is only with your support that it can continue each year.  Please look at the classes and make an entry.  The more we get the better the show. 

Produce may be claimed at the end of the Show or may be left for the auction, which will raise money for Society funds.

If you have any questions, or would like to check the guidance from the RHS, please do not hesitate to [contact a committee member](../SocietyContacts).  We look forward to receiving your entries.  Thank you and good luck.
