# News and Events

## 2020 Calendar

It is with great regret that the Souldern Horticultural Society announces the cancellation of this year’s annual flower & produce show.

SHS Chairperson Carol Gray said, ‘We know how important this event is to the village and it’s a great pity that we have to cancel at a time when local interest in gardening is so strong. However, having consulted with a range of people involved with the organisation of the show, we feel that it would be extremely unwise to proceed when Coronavirus still poses such a threat.

'Our aim now is to channel the enthusiasm for vegetable and flower growing into making our 2021 event a bumper show.’

The Royal Horticultural Society, to which the Souldern Horticultural Society is affiliated, has cancelled all its 2020 events. 

## Seed Order Discount Scheme

We have a discount scheme arranged with Suttons Seeds. For the latest update [click here](SeedOrders).

The Cheese and Wine Evening on 24th January was a great success. Thanks to all who assisted and attended.
