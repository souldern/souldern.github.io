# “Kindness Box” project.


![Samuel and Box](samuel-box.jpg)

My son Samuel is running a Kindness box project.

A box will be left with some essentials (pasta, canned goods) on the pond bench.

Feel free  to take something that you need, or put in anything extra that you have.

We will put this out daily in the morning and keep it safe in the evening.

**Please Support it!!**

Yusudi and Samuel Santosa at Treetops, Souldern.
