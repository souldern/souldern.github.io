---

The Fox Inn Souldern  🦊We will be reopening for outside eating and
drinking from **Saturday 4th July** and look forward to welcoming you
back! To ensure the safety of customers and staff The Fox will be
operating a little differently than before.


Our "garden restaurant" facilities will include 5 Cabanas, plus 4 open
tables. They'll be bookable for those eating pre-ordered food. Due to
popular demand, we’re going to continue with takeaway food 🥡, using
the usual menu with various specials, now including a Sunday Roast
option too, or you can book to **eat in the garden** from 5.30 to 7.30pm
(Thursday, Friday & Saturday) and 12.00 till 2.30pm Sunday.

In addition, we'll have tables and chairs available in the courtyard
under cover in the marquee for customers just wishing to drink. 🥃 🥂
A few select tables will be available in the pub, dependant on the
number of people in your party. **Drinking hours**: Thursday & Friday 5pm
to 9pm; Saturday 12pm to 9pm; Sunday 12pm to 5pm.

IMPORTANT‼️ : As space will be limited due to social distancing being
in operation please plan and book ahead to guarantee your spot. Leave
us a message on 01869 345284 with your booking request and the
following details for :-

The backing we've received from the village during Lockdown has been
invaluable and your continued support through this next challenging
phase would be SO appreciated too. We'll be as flexible as possible
within the guidelines, even if things change as we move forward. Rest
assured all will be explained on arrival but please bear with us,
respect others and continue to social distance (minimum 1 metre).
