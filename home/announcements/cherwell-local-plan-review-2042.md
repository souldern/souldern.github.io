##Overview

We have prepared a new Local Plan for Cherwell District and would like
your views before we submit it to the Secretary of State for
independent examination.

**All comments must be submitted by 11.59pm on Tuesday 25 February 2025..**

The Local Plan will guide our decisions on planning applications and
contribute to the achievement of sustainable development. It is a Plan
to meet our development needs, to respond to climate change, to
protect the environment and to support our local economy and
communities.

The Plan sets out a vision and proposes homes, employment land,
infrastructure and other essential services required to support the
local community over the plan period.
