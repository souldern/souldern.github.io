# Playground Closure

Following the directive given by the Prime Minister in his statement of 23rd March, Souldern Parish Council has no alternative but to announce the immediate closure of the playground at the playing fields until further notice.

The stark message given by Boris Johnson was very clear and we expect all parishioners to respect the new rules.
