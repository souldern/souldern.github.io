# COVID 19 – Souldern Parish Council Community Support network

With the escalation of the COVID 19 situation there is a network of volunteers in Souldern who are
willing to offer assistance where it is needed in the village with everyday tasks from collecting
prescriptions through to shopping/ grasscutting and dogwalking etc. There are also two medical
professionals in the village who are willing to offer informal advice should anybody want to talk to
them.

Through the use of our village Whatsapp group we are communicating to as many parishioners as
we can reach and taking steps to be there to support those who might need to self / family isolate in
the coming weeks. As a community the network is there to help those that need it.
If you are not a member of the Village Whatsapp group please send a message to Nick Oakhill on
07845 594099, who will then put you onto the circulation list.
We recognise the fact that some parishioners will not be whatsapp users, and ask those that do, to
buddy up with neighbours who don’t so that everybody can be on the circulation list or at the most
one step away from it.

Alternatively, if you require assistance or feel able to offer help please make yourself known to any
of the following in the village;

John Hoodless, email: [motorvat@aol.com](mailto:motorvat@aol.com) or tel; 07785391591

Susan Jones, email; [susan.jones@headlinersgroup.com](mailto:susan.jones@headlinersgroup.com) or tel; 07802 668434.

network of volunteers is there to provide assistance where it is needed and will be happy to do what
they can.
