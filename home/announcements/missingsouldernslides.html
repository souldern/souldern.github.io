<p>In the 1970s and onwards John McDouall the Parish Clerk together with 
other Villagers took a number of slides of Souldern and its activities 
as an historic record of events. He gave them to the Village hall 
Committee for safe keeping and for fund raising. There followed a number
 of shows to Village audiences which were much appreciated. Contained in
 a medium sized cardboard box tied around with string and marked “The 
property of Souldern Village Hall”, unfortunately the box appears to be 
have been mislaid. </p>
<p>If anyone knows of its whereabouts now, would they please contact Katy 
Draper, Barbara McGarry or Ann Prescott or use the <a href="/home/contact-website">website contact form</a>. It's very important that they 
are found. Thank you. </p>
