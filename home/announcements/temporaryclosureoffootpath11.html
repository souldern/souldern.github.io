<p align="center" style="text-align:center"><span style="font-size:14.0pt">ADVANCE NOTICE: TEMPORARY CLOSURE OF FOOTPATH 11</span></p>
<p>Notification has been received from the Canal and River
Trust that further remedial work is required on the swing bridge over the canal
just beyond the Chisnell farm buildings. At the moment it seems likely that
there will be a Temporary Traffic Regulation Order (TTRO), closing <a href="/recreational-areas/footpaths/351-11">Footpath 11,
(from Chisnell Farm to the canal)</a>, between October 2016 and February 2017.</p>
<p>The following information is from the Canal and River
Trust:</p>
<div style="margin-left:2em;margin-right:2em">
<p><b><span style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;color:#1f497d">Dates
of PROW closure:</span></b></p>
<p><span style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;color:#1f497d">At present, we are awaiting confirmation of costs for our
intended works from our contractors, along with their intended construction
programme. This will then determine more precise dates that the bridge will be
closed from and to. The request that I have made from October through to
February is worst case, but I can see this maybe being reduced as we finalise
our plans. At present, we should be having this information back to use by the
end of this month so I can update you again at that time.</span></p>
<p><b><span style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;color:#1f497d">Detail
works being done:</span></b></p>
<p><span style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;color:#1f497d">The bridge and section of the canal will be dewatered in
November and December. This will mean closure of canal to boats, but the
towpath will remain open</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;color:#1f497d">The bridge deck will be temporarily removed to allow for safe
working within the canal, the rebuilding of sections of wall and hopefully the
strengthening of the bridge deck itself since it is actively used by landowners
to reach their fields.</span><span style="font-size:12.5pt;font-family:Arial,sans-serif">
</span><span style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;color:#1f497d">Two new brick approach walls are being built</span><span style="font-size:12.5pt;font-family:Arial,sans-serif">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;color:#1f497d">Brick repairs to the remaining two approach walls and 2
abutments</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;color:#1f497d">Repairs to the canal floor to prevent further scour / erosion
and the same thing happening again</span></p>

<p><b><span style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;color:#1f497d">Temporary</span></b><b><span style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;color:#1f497d"> Bridge</span></b><b><span style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;color:#1f497d">:</span></b></p>
<p><span style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;color:#1f497d">The idea of a temporary bridge has been mentioned and discussed
by me with the following people:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;color:#1f497d">CRT Management, out contractors, yourself, Sarah, landowners and
our boating community.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;color:#1f497d">Despite trying, the cost of a temporary bridge to allow boaters
to pass underneath it and be suitable for people to walk over is proving very
high. The high costs are not only due to the length / span that would be
needed, but also due to location. As you are aware, this bridge is in an extremely
rural setting, which means a long way to transport everything to the site by
water or via landowners fields.</span><span style="font-size:12.5pt;font-family:Arial,sans-serif"> </span><span style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;color:#1f497d">A slight reduction in cost would be to have a temporary crossing
only when the canal is shut. This idea however wouldn’t work since we need to have
the main PROW closure and bridge deck removed for a longer period than when the
canal is shut in order to undertake site set up and maximise our time in the
dewatered canal to undertake bridge repairs. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;color:#1f497d">I have tried to gain sponsorship for this temporary bridge and
whilst partially successfully, have fallen woefully short of the projected
cost.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;color:#1f497d">I am still trying to get different costs / design options
investigated and reviewed, but am mindful that the area of land required, along
with access over the landowners fields and timeframes are not in our favour.
 Lastly, I was also disappointingly informed by the council that even if
there was a temporary footbridge / crossing with a very short (no more than
100m) deviation off the designated PROW, I was still going to be charged a full
fee for the full duration of my works, to the same cost as if I was applying
for a full PROW closure with no temporary bridge.</span></p>
<p><b><span style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;color:#1f497d">Second
Closure in recent years:</span></b></p>
<p><span style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;color:#1f497d">The bridge was previously closed by CRT on 30<sup>th</sup>
October 2014, reopening on 1<sup>st</sup> April 2015. A TTRO was in place from
17<sup>th</sup> Nov 2014 to 1<sup>st</sup> April 2015. The reason for this
closure was that during routine bridge inspections, it was noticed that the
canal wall was failing. This led to divers being brought to site to confirm how
bad the damage was, with the results showing very poor. The bridge was chained
/ locked in the open position, so not affecting boat users (although the canal
was shut in other locations due to planned stoppages so technically no boats
were using this section of waterway for 2 months anyway) but it did result in
the closing of the PROW. This closure did not stop emergency services or access
to the adjacent property so long as we were made aware. The decision was made
to chain open the bridge to prevent the bridge deck from continually “bouncing”
every time it was opened and shut, therefore dislodging more brickwork which
could eventually lead to catastrophic bridge failure (this did happen to a
nearby bridge 215, at the same time as this temporary closure, resulting in
complete loss of all brickwork and the deck, with it all ending up in the
bottom of the canal and rendered unsalvageable).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;color:#1f497d">Emergency plans were put in place to undertake temporary repair
works (the same ones that I eluded to above). The temporary works had to be
designed costed and implemented, all with agreement with our engineers, our
local heritage team and also English Heritage. These agreements were not made and
signed off until well into the new year, and by the time all parties had signed
and agreed, it was March 2015. The actual repairs works once the contractors
were out on site in March 2015 took a short amount of time, allowing the bridge
and PROW to be re-opened 1<sup>st</sup> April 2015.</span></p>
</div>
<p>As you can see, attempts have been made to keep the Pubic Right
of Way, (PROW) open by means of a temporary bridge, but it looks as though the
cost of this will be prohibitive. I will post any further update on the notice
boards and website.</p>
