# Cherwell Local Plan Review 2040 Consultation Draft (Reg 18)
## Notification of Public Consultation

Dear Town and Parish Council

 

At its meeting on 4 September 2023, the Council’s Executive approved the draft Cherwell Local Plan Review 2040 for public consultation (as amended by the agreed changes).

 

I am writing to inform you that the public consultation will commence on **Friday 22 September 2023** for a period of 6 weeks. The consultation will close on **3 November 2023**.

During the consultation key documents will be available to view at Bodicote House and libraries across the District. All documents will also be available on the Council’s website and its Citizen’s Space consultation platform.

 

Each town/parish council will also be sent a copy of the draft Local Plan, together with some publicity material.

 

In addition to the public exhibitions, we will be holding workshops for town and parish councils to discuss the draft local plan.  Invitations to these will be sent shortly once dates and timings have been set.

 

[**Further information is in the public notice attached.**](FINAL Public Notice September 2023.pdf)

 

If you have any questions regarding the consultation, then please do contact us.

 

 

Kind regards
