I wanted to contact you all regarding the **new bus service** [ABILITY](https://www.abilitycic.org.uk) is
preparing to launch which will be covering your parishes. The is an
exciting new opportunity which will provide a link between these rural
villages and connect residents to Bicester town centre.

 


The official launch date is the **16th of July**. 

From then we will begin running buses on two separate routes every
Friday morning, with the intention of expanding this to Mondayâ€™s
(provided there is the demand for this). This will offer residents a
chance to reach Bicester market on Fridays and access any other
essential services in the town.

 

This service will be completely free of charge for anyone with a
concessionary bus pass once they are registered with us.

 

The two routes will broadly seek to mirror those of the Comet bus:


*  **Souldern**, Fritwell, Fewcott, Ardley, Bucknell, Chesterton, Bicester

*    Cottisford, Mixbury, Finmere (Little Tingewick), Newton Purcell, Hethe, Hardwick, Stoke Lyne, Bicester

 

Whilst we will run these two routes on a regular weekly basis,
becoming an ABILITY member will also give residents access to our
**popular trips service**. Throughout the year we put on weekly trips to
popular destinations around the county, giving passengers the chance
to have a fun day out somewhere a bit further afield than they would
normally be able to travel on the bus.
