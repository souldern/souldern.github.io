<div><span style="FONT-SIZE:10pt">Dear Parish Clerk</span></div>
<div> </div>
<div>I am writing to you, and to all the other Parish Clerks in Deddington Ward, 
to explain why I, as one of your (three) elected Members to Cherwell District 
Council, will be voting against the Oxfordshire Housing and Growth Deal (the 
Deal) when it comes to Full Council on <span><span>26th February</span></span>.  This puts me at odds 
with the Leadership of the Council and in defiance of the Whip.  Please 
could you forward this to members of your Parish Council (who are, of course, 
free to circulate it as they see fit).</div>
<div> </div>
<div>I attach:</div>
<div>
<ul style="FONT-SIZE:10pt;FONT-FAMILY:tahoma"><li><span style="FONT-SIZE:13px">the full text of the "Oxfordshire Housing 
  and Growth Deal - Outline Agreement" (13 pages), and</span>
</li><li><span style="FONT-SIZE:13px">the Cherwell District Council paper headed 
  "Growth Board recommends housing and growth deal" (4 pages)</span></li></ul>
<div>Both are public documents and available on-line</div>
<div> </div>
<div>By way of background, the Deal is essentially that which the Chancellor of 
the Exchequer announced in his Autumn Budget, last November, when he stated that 
he had come to an agreement with "Oxfordshire" to build 100,000 new houses in 
the County, in exchange for up to £215m of Government money</div>
<div> </div>
<div>The £215m amounts to £150m for infrastructure spending "to unlock key 
housing sites", £60m for "affordable housing" and £5m for "resource funding to 
boost capacity to get a joint plan in place" (see para 42 of the Outline 
Agreement).  The 100,000 new houses need to be delivered by 2031, some of 
which have already been built.  In addition, "Oxfordshire" commits to the 
submission and adoption, subject to the inspection process, of a Joint Statutory 
Spatial Plan, covering all 5 District Councils, by 2021</div>
<div> </div>
<div>At the time of the Chancellor's announcement, it was not clear to me 
whether there was to be a vote on this proposal.  In fact, as I now 
understand it all 5 District Councils (including City of Oxford) have agreed to 
put it to the vote of all their Elected Members while Oxfordshire County Council 
is restricting the vote to Cabinet Members only.  There is to be no Public 
Consultation.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>I have made my views extremely clear to the Leadership of Cherwell and have 
indicated that I will be voting against the proposal, having considered the 
following points:</div>
<div>
<ul style="FONT-SIZE:10pt;FONT-FAMILY:tahoma"><li><span style="FONT-SIZE:13px"><b>100,000 new houses is too many</b> - I 
  fully accept that some new housing is required, not least to prevent a 
  youth-drain, but this can be addressed by small-scale sympathetic developments 
  where the marginal increase in population can be easily assimilated by, and 
  welcomed into, the host-community whilst preserving intact the fabric of that 
  community.  The new giant housing estates on the edge of, and around, 
  villages, which will be the inevitable outcome of the Deal, with their 
  substantial populations (and cars), will, by their sheer scale, destroy the 
  historic communities they come to dominate.   Ancient villages will 
  become anachronistic and quaint centres of soul-less dormitory towns.  
  S</span>ome of the 100,000 houses have now been completed, but as the Outline 
  Agreement, itself, makes clear at para 25 this quantum is "recognised as 
  significantly in excess of the Local Housing Need figures set out in the 
  Government consultation paper 'Planning for the right homes in the right 
  places (DCLG Sept 2017)'".  The 100,000 figure was always regarded, by 
  many, as being flawed (even before the Brexit vote and the impact this could 
  have on population trends) and now the Government, itself, admits that it is 
  over-blown.  Why, therefore, is the Deal still pushing this figure?? 
  ..... and why are the Oxfordshire Council Leaders so anxious to accommodate it 
  by accepting the Growth Board's recommendation ...... ??  (NB: the 6 
  Oxfordshire Council Leaders are the only voting members of the Growth Board, 
  thus they are recommending it to themselves) </li></ul>
<div> </div></div>
<div>
<ul style="FONT-SIZE:10pt;FONT-FAMILY:tahoma"><li><span style="FONT-SIZE:13px"><b>£150m of new infrastructure is too 
  little</b> - ........ surely, it cannot be simply to secure £150m  of 
  infrastructure funding?? - which figure is so tiny as to be meaningless in 
  terms of what is needed to support the existing population, let alone a 
  further 300,000 - 400,000 people who will inhabit the new housing.  In 
  any event, as para 42 of the Outline Agreement makes clear, the £150m is for 
  infrastructure to "unlock key housing sites" so not really to ameliorate the 
  current situation at all.  The Oxfordshire Infrastructure Strategy 2017 
  identified £8.35bn of infrastructure investment needed for Oxfordshire by 
  2040, which is 55-times the derisory amount on offer as part of the 
  Deal</span></li></ul>
<div> </div></div>
<div>
<ul style="FONT-SIZE:10pt;FONT-FAMILY:tahoma"><li><span style="FONT-SIZE:13px"><b>Will we lose control of the Planning 
  Process??</b> - </span>I have no confidence that the Local Plans will be able 
  to withstand the pressures exerted by MHCLG (Ministry of Housing, Communities 
  and Local Government) despite the protections seemingly offered by para 65 of 
  the Outline Agreement, which in any case appear to evaporate upon completion 
  of the JSSP in 2021.  Para 66 offers little comfort as the Cherwell Local 
  Plan can, in my view, be subverted by the Partial Review of Part 1 (dealing 
  with Oxford City's Unmet Housing Need) and Part 2  - both of which are 
  yet to be completed, examined and adopted.  More worringly, Para 49 
  states that "ongoing work may focus on a number of areas, including .... the 
  use of powers, such as Compulsory Purchase Orders"</li></ul><span style="FONT-SIZE:10pt">Whichever way I read the Deal it is bad news for a great 
number of existing residents of Oxfordshire, turning an essentially rural county 
into a suburban one and, as such, I will vote against it</span></div>
<div><span style="FONT-SIZE:10pt"><br /></span></div>
<div><span style="FONT-SIZE:10pt">I accept that there may be many people who 
support the Deal and I should be delighted to hear the views of anyone, whether 
in favour or against, so please do e-mail me at
