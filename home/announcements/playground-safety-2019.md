# ROSPA Safety Inspection Report on the Playground

The full Safety Inspection Report for the village playground equipment
is [available from this website](/parish-council/spc-documents/ROSPA%20Report%20November%202019.pdf)


*Please Note*:

Some items have been classified as unsafe and will require immediate action.

The rope climbing frame and swing logs will be removed shortly, and the big slide will be closed until remedial work can be completed.

We apologise for any inconvenience caused, but this course of action is necessary for safety reasons.
