# Souldern Advent Trail 2020

## Souldern Village Advent Trail 2020

We are hoping to create a trail through the village, adding a new
window for every day in December. We are looking for people who would
like to create a simple feature in a window of their home for one
allocated date.

This will be a seasonal event for anyone in the village community and
windows can feature any scenes, symbols or objects associated with the
time of year. The trail will end at the church with a display for
Christmas Eve, regardless of whether services can take place.

Please let Heidi know by Saturday 7th November if you would like to
create a display in a window in your home to feature in the trail by
emailing [heididennison27@gmail.com](mailto:heididennison27@gmail.com), joining the ‘Souldern Advent
Trail’ WhatsApp group or writing a note to Anvil Cottage, High
Street. Allocated dates will be published a week later.

Do pass this [PDF poster](Souldern Advent Trail 2020.pdf) and information on to anyone you think might like to take part!


## Souldern Village Advent Trail  Extra Information

* The plan is to create a trail, adding a new window for every day in
  December. Once the window is in the trail, it stays there, so that
  by the 24th December there are 24 windows with an object or scene,
  much like an advent calendar with all the windows open.

* The display can be a single item or a scene that represents the
  season from your point of view. It can be related to Christmas or
  another festival in December, winter, hope, community, peace,
  support or friendship.

* The number of the date in December that has been allocated to the
  window should feature somehow, whether as part of the scene or
  separately.

* It would be ideal if the windows chosen can be seen from the road,
  unless you are happy for people to walk onto your driveway.

*  Some windows may be better viewed by day, some by night. It need not
  matter which.

* Outlying houses are likely to be included for weekend dates, so that
  these can be visited with more time and daylight.

* People may choose to see each new window on the day it appears, or
  to pick up the trail again each weekend
