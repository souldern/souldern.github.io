# Cherwell Cats Protection launches February £15 ‘Snip and Chip’ Campaign 

## Because Cats Don't Do Lockdowns 

Cherwell Cats Protection which covers Banbury, Bicester, Brackley and
Kidlington, has again teamed up with seven (7) veterinary practices in
their branch area to launch a £15 cat neutering and microchipping
scheme to run throughout the month of February 2021.

For only £15, cat owners can have their pets spayed or snipped and
chipped at participating veterinary clinics with the remainder of the
costs being covered by Cats Protection.  The participating veterinary
practices teaming up with Cherwell Cats Protection for this scheme are
Beaumont Vet Group (Kidlington), Hawthorne Lodge Vets (Banbury), Hook
Norton Vets (Deddington), Medivet (Kidlington), Vets4Pets (Banbury),
Vets4Pets (Bicester) and West Bar Vets (Banbury).

If the cat or kitten doesn’t need both procedures, then owners also
have the option of £5 microchipping or £10 neutering only.  The
neutering offer covers one routine neutering procedure for a healthy
kitten or cat.

All surgeries are to be performed between February 1st through
February 28th, and any additional costs during or after surgery are to
be covered by the cat owners.  Pet owners must live in postcode(s) –
OX5, OX15, OX16, OX17, OX25, OX26, OX27 or NN13 to be eligible.

The benefits of neutering are enormous as not only is it the most
humane way to reduce unwanted pregnancies, but it also makes cats less
likely to roam, to spray and to fight, reducing the possibility of
contracting life-threatening diseases that can be transmitted by bites
and saliva.  Cats Protection recommends that cats are neutered at
around four months of age or younger.

Don’t forget, cats don’t accept lockdown and will still roam at will,
especially now springtime is coming!

Microchipping, which involves a small data chip being inserted under
the cat’s skin under the shoulder blades, has important benefits too.
With the details stored in a national database, it gives owners some
peace of mind that they will be reunited with their pet cat should it
ever go missing.
