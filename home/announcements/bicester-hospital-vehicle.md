# Bicester Community Hospital League Of Friends donate new patient vehicle to the hospital

Bicester Community Hospital League of Friends (LOF) have purchased a new
vehicle replacing an older one donated by the LOF in 2001. The vehicle will be
used by Bicester Community Hospital to transport patients with restricted
mobility to their own homes for an in home assessment. The vehicle is
specially adapted to include an electric winch, which enables the wheelchair
bound patient to be assisted into the vehicle easily, via a ramp.

Patients due to be discharged, are taken to their own homes accompanied by a
member of the Therapy Team (Oxfordshire Health Care Support Services). An
assessment is carried out as to what aids they need and arrangements are then
made for them to be implemented, before the patient returns home.

The new vehicle will be handed over to the Therapy Team at a special
presentation attended by The Mayor of Bicester, Jason Slaymaker. This will
take place on Saturday 1 st June 2019 at 12.30 pm outside the hospital. The
ceremony will also be attended by the Chairman of Oxfordshire County
Council, Les Sibley, representatives of the hospital staff and members of the
League of Friends. The Friends hope that members of the public will also join
them at the hospital for the presentation.

The League of Friends work hard to support Bicester Community hospital by
fundraising to supply equipment not provided by the NHS. They also give their
time helping on the wards by bed making, serving teas and interacting with the
patients.
