# New House Search Page

The site has a new facility to [search for houses](/home/houses). Currently you can
search on any combination of house names, road names and postcodes.

Images are provided for each house, but submissions for new house
images are welcome, also any corrections to the data may be made
via the [contact form](/home/contact-website.html) or
emailing [website@souldern.org](mailto:website@souldern.org).

Each house image links to a Google Streetmap view of the house (for
those houses in the area covered by steetview).

Typical search: all the [Souldern "barns":](/home/houses/?h=barn)
