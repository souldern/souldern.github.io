# Spruce up Souldern!

Any help with sweeping, trimming and tidying paths, pavements and
shared spaces outside or around your home would be much appreciated!
Souldern Parish Council and Souldern United Charities have been
reviewing village upkeep with the aim of creating a planned approach
to maintaining all corners of our special village. There will be
various phases to gradually improve things over the coming months, but
we are hoping we can count on support from the village for Stage 1!

**Across the month of June**, you could help us by tidying areas in front
of or around your home. This could just be sweeping any extra winter
debris away, or trimming any plants that have sprouted on the
kerbsides through the spring. However, if you spot anything else that
could do with a small amount of attention and you have time, please do
take the opportunity this month to help tidy the village.  We will be
looking for assistance with slightly larger tasks and projects going
forwards, so watch this space for details, whilst helping with these
little jobs to get things going!

**_Thank you!_**
