# ST MARY’S CHURCH REORDERING PROJECT

As many of you know the PCC has a project to bring the church into the 21st century by adding a WC and various other facilities.

Added to this we need to carry out essential repairs including to the roof which has several leaks.

Come along to our **Easter Extravaganza Open Weekend** and see our plans.

Over the weekend and Easter Monday there will be  
Floral Displays, Children’s Activities and Arts & Crafts to see and for sale —  and if you can make it we’ll be serving  
**Cream Teas** on **Monday** from 2–4pm!

All profits will be going towards the church

We need to fundraise about £400k for the work — please help!
