# Ten Years of Souldern.org


The [souldern.org](https://www.souldern.org) website went live **ten
years ago** today!

[First post, September 4th 2015](/home/announcements/testingthenewsouldernwebsite).

Originally conceived as a means to meet the statutory requirements for
the Parish Council to post minutes of meetings and annual financial
statements (see [Transparency](/parish-council/transparency)), the site
now hosts around 650 web pages and 320 PDF files covering many aspects
of village life, including:
[general announcements](/home/announcements), [village history](/history),
[a pictorial guide to all local footpaths](/recreational-areas/footpaths/),
[guides to local services and
trades](https://www.souldern.org/home/local-services), and
several [slideshows](/home/gallery) showing village related pictures (hosted on the website's Google Photos account).

Originally hosted at [Google Sites](https://sites.google.com), since September 2018 the site has been hosted at [GitHub Pages](https://docs.github.com/en/pages).

I hope you find it useful. If you have ideas for further information pages, or a local organisation that could benefit from an area on the website,
please contact us at [website@souldern.org](mailto:website@souldern.org).
