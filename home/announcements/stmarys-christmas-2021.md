I’ve designed a Souldern Christmas Card and will be taking orders this
week with a view to putting the print order in on Sunday and receiving
them at the end of next week.

Their size is 150x150mm and they’ll be
printed on 100% recycled matt paper and will come with eco recycled
envelopes. 

Price is £1.25 per card or £10 for a pack of ten. I will
donate 10% of any profits made to the Souldern village charity. If you
would like a bigger order I can quote a bulk price.

Please message me
directly (07947 055232) if you would like to make an order. 

Best wishes, Harriet  
(Hill Cottage)
