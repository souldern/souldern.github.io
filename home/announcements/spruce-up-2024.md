# Spruce up Souldern!


     
![spruce up souldern](spruce-up-2023.png)

Souldern Parish Council is planning a big village Spring Clean day on
**Saturday 13th April**, which will coincide with the Keep Britain Tidy
Great British Spring Clean and the Cherwell District Council Spring
Clean initiative.

We would appreciate lots of help to undertake tidying and maintenance
tasks, large and small, across the day.

We aim to start from **9am** and there will be bacon rolls available from
The Fox a little later to help keep our energies up!

We will gather the names of all those willing to help in a few weeks
in order to plan teams for tasks, but for the moment, please save the
date in your diaries.
