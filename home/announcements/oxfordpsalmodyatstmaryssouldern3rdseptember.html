Visit to Souldern Church <br />
10 am Saturday 3rd September 2016 <br />
<br />
Since
 the year 2000 a group of singers and instrumentalists have met together
 annually on the first Saturday in September to sing what has become 
known as West Gallery music, sometimes also Georgian Psalmody. Supported
 by Immanuel’s Ground, Warwick’s West Gallery Quire, our itinerary on 
3rd September will be <b>Souldern</b> (10.00 am), Aynho (11.30 am), Bloxham 
(1.45 pm), Wigginton (3.00 pm), and South Newington (5.00 pm).  <br />
<br />
We
 sing because we love the music, not by Tallis, Byrd, and other such 
‘art music’ composers, but by lesser known church composers, many of 
whom were artisans, farm workers, and members of quires who sang 
faithfully every week in their local churches and chapels, and of bands 
who played for social village occasions. <br />
<br />
Do come and listen to 
music which was swept away by Victorian reformers and Hymns Ancient 
&amp; Modern in 1861, and enjoy the music of rural parish churches in 
the days before organs and surpliced choirboys took over – this is a 
very informal ‘get together’ of friends and enthusiasts, but we welcome 
the opportunity of  encouraging a wider audience to enjoy the music we 
love.<br />
