# BICESTER COMMUNITY HOSPITAL

##  LEAGUE OF FRIENDS APPEAL

Bicester Community hospital, also fondly known as the ‘Cottage
Hospital’ has been well served for many years by the volunteer group
known as ‘The League of Friends’.

This group of volunteers contribute to the hospital in various ways,
making beds, serving teas and raising funds.  The money raised by The
League contributes towards items for the patients that the NHS does
not supply.  Amongst these many items are upright safety fans which
were especially appreciated during this year’s hot summer .

To help them continue this worthwhile work, The League of Friends will
be holding their annual fundraising Christmas bazaar and coffee
morning on Wednesday 21st November at the Littlebury Hotel in
Bicester.

The bazaar runs from 10.30 to 12.30 and the £2 entry includes
tea/coffee, cake and door prize.  There will be a homemade cake stall
and a white elephant stall, there will also be a raffle and Christmas
cards will be on sale.

Donations of good quality brik-a-brak, cakes and raffle prizes will be
gratefully received. Donors can bring donations to the coffee morning
or contact Wendy on 01869 252246 for information on where to take
them.
