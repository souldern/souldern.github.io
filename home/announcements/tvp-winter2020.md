# Thames Valley Police: Winter Burglary Campaign

Good afternoon,

 

Firstly please allow me to introduce myself, I am the recently
appointed Geographical Neighbourhood Sergeant for Bicester and
Kidlington Police area taking over the role from my predecessor
Sergeant Kerry O’LEARY.

 

I very much look forward to working with the community and supporting
my Neighbourhood Supervisors PC Vicky LEES and PC David SCOTT and the
experienced team of PCSO’s I now work with.

 

As we enter the winter months there will be a national Winter Burglary
campaign which will be advertised on social media combined with high
visibility patrols to provide residents with crime prevention advice
particularly in the build up to Christmas and to deter would be
offenders.

 

This will include high visibility patrols, leaflet drops and crime
prevention advice along with reassurance patrols from the NHPT.

 

I have taken the opportunity to provide you with electronic versions
of our crime prevention leaflets for onward dissemination as you see
fit amongst the members of Parish Council and residents.

 

If any of the attachments do not work please let me know. Similarly if
yourself or any of the Parish council have any specific concerns
regarding individuals being particularly vulnerable please let myself,
PC LEES, PCSO BAILEY or PCSO BEAUMONT know and we will make
arrangements for a home visit by one of the team to conduct a crime
prevention visit.

 

Kind regards

 
Gavin
