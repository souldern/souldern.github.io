consultation into the possible diversion of<a href="/recreational-areas/footpaths/351-1"> footpath 1</a>, which
currently runs through Lower Souldern Grounds farm. Joe Abernethy of
Lower Souldern Grounds attended the Parish Council meeting on 17th
November 2016 to outline the new route. Details are below,
and in the maps (which link to the original PDF documents).</p><div style="display:block;text-align:center;margin-right:auto;margin-left:auto"><a href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B-RXUofQrIQxek00dFVyZVVnR2s" imageanchor="1"><img border="0" height="400" src="/home/announcements/consultationonfootpath1lowersoulderngroundsfarm-files/Definitive%20Map%20extract.png" width="282" /></a></div><div style="display:block;text-align:center;margin-right:auto;margin-left:auto"><a href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B-RXUofQrIQxVE1xMi1lR09MUEk" imageanchor="1"><img border="0" height="283" src="/home/announcements/consultationonfootpath1lowersoulderngroundsfarm-files/Plan%20HA1980-508.png" width="400" /></a></div><br />
<p>
</p><p>As only a small number of
villagers were at the meeting, further comments on the proposal would
be helpful in informing the Parish Council response to OCC. Please
send any comments to <a href="mailto:katydraper@souldern.org">katydraper@souldern.org</a>, by 21st January 2017. If
the proposal proceeds to a formal application, there will be further
opportunity for comments to be made directly to OCC at that stage.</p>
<h2><a name="TOC-The-Footpath-to-be-Diverted"></a>The Footpath to be Diverted</h2>
<p>The existing footpath to be diverted (A-B) begins to the east of Lower
Souldern Grounds which lies to the south-west of the M 40 motorway
(Point A). It runs westwards along the farm drive into the farmyard
area (for approx.150m) between the farm buildings. It continues
westwards out of the yard along the track to the Souldern Viaduct
(Point B). The existing path is 519m long.</p>
<h2><a name="TOC-The-proposed-footpath"></a>The proposed footpath</h2>
<p>The diversion would be to a new route A-C-D-E-B running parallel with
the farm track and within the field area immediately to the north of
the farm buildings. The vast majority of the field is laid to
arable. There are two narrow paddocks along its southern boundary
beside the farm track/farmyard area. The path would enter the field
from the east between a hedge and field gates (Point A) and run
westwards toward the viaduct between the grass paddock areas and the
arable area. At Point E it would reach the viaduct and turn southwards
for a short distance through a gap to re-join the existing footpath
and track.</p>
<p>The new route would have a definitive width of 2.5m, have a grass
surface along its entire length and be free from structures. The
current electric fencing arrangements would be replaced with stock
fencing and plain wire.  The northern side of the footpath would be
unfenced and open to the arable field.</p>
<h2><a name="TOC-Reasons-for-the-Diversion"></a>Reasons for the Diversion</h2>
<p>The proposed diversion is to provide the public with extended views of
the Souldern Viaduct (built in 1910). Approaching the viaduct along
the proposed footpath (537m long) walkers would have uninterrupted
views of the structure including views of countryside to the north
across the arable field. This would then mean that the viaduct could
be seen whilst walking along the whole footpath. By contrast the
existing path, in running through the farm and between hedges, only
provides a view of the viaduct at its very western end. Views of the
farm, stables and stock sheds will continue to exist from the proposed
route.</p></div></td></tr></tbody></table>
