<h1>Souldern Wesleyan Reform Chapel</h1>

<p style="text-align:center;color:#A00;font-size:200%;">
The Chapel is not closing but we have
decided to temporarily suspend our
weekly Sunday Services while we work on
a new plan for a monthly event which we
hope will be of interest to many more
people.<br/>
Further details soon.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;color:#00A;font-size:200%;">
 Meanwhile, the Sunday School will
continue at Chapel on the first Sunday of
each month.</p>
