<hr />
<p style="margin-left:40px">Following from the Souldern Vision survey, we
have not done enough to involve our more senior
members of the community. We are wishing to
remedy this situation, and so a Christmas lunch is being
organised that will take place on 7th December in the
village hall and will be funded by some of the proceeds from
the recent Autumn Sale organised by Linda Palmer.</p><div style="margin-left:40px">
</div><p style="margin-left:40px">The Village Networks Experts Roadshow
will be attending the lunch and will be able to offer practical
help and advice on matters that are of concern and there
will also be ‘time to talk’ on suggestions for future get
togethers and events so all suggestions welcome. Please
look out for further details or contact Barbara (345931) if
you would like to come.</p></div></td></tr></tbody></table>
