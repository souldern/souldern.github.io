# Parish Council End of Year Accounts

During the 19/20 financial year Souldern Parish Council spent Â£1750 less than in the previous year.

This is due to the fact that in 18/19 we had a number of one off costs
( Repairs to Churchyard wall/ playground fence and defibrillator)
which had to be met.

During the 19/20 financial year the council commissioned some remedial
tree surgery, which had been long overdue, and spent more on village
grass cutting (in order to avoid a repeat of the 18/19 season).

Should anybody wish to see a detailed breakdown of the material
variances between 18/19 and 19/20 financial accounts our RFO, Laura
How has conducted a detailed analysis of these. To request a copy and
explanation please send an email to
