# Road Resurfacing: Souldern â€“ Fritwell

Hi,



On behalf of Oxfordshire CC, I am the one of the engineers responsible
for delivering the resurfacing of Souldern Farm Lane which forms the
boundary between the parishes of Souldern and Fritwell.  Hopefully,
you have been consulted as part of the TTRO approval process but just
in case, I always like to make sure everyone is informed as much as
possible ðŸ˜Š

 

I would therefore like to ensure you are aware that Souldern Farm Lane
will be fully closed for 3 consecutive daytime shifts between 07:00 â€“
19:00hrs from **Monday 20th June** to **Wednesday 22nd June 2022**, to enable
us to complete the required works.

 

The roadspace permit is approved and the TTRO in place, with a copy
attached for reference.

I also attach a copy of the scheme general arrangement drawing which
shows the scope of works, along with the agreed diversion drawing
showing the route which will be fully signed for the duration, as an
alternative means of access.

 

I will be sending out a letter to the properties within the works area
itself, which will include the Lower & Upper Souldern Farms as well as
Inkerman Farm. A copy of this letter is also attached for your
reference.  These letters are timed to arrive 2 weeks prior to
starting on site which is also when the advance warning boards will go
out.

 

Please feel free to pass this information to your respective
constituents or publicise as you see fit.

 

I am more than happy to answer any queries or questions you may have
regarding these works or arrangements.

 

Kind regards,

 

Jamie Moore

Pavement Engineer | Milestone Infrastructure
