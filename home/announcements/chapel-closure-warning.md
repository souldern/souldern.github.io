# SOULDERN CHAPEL IS ON THE BRINK OF CLOSURE

Souldern Wesleyan Reform Chapel in Back Lane has been
welcoming people for almost 150 years, to its weekly services
and to the Sunday School.

We had hoped to celebrate our 150th Anniversary next year in
June 2019 but sadly this is now looking very unlikely.

Due to ever decreasing numbers at the weekly services and less
and less support for the special events such as the recent Harvest
Supper and Service we are now looking at the very real
possibility of closing permanently in the New Year.

If the Chapel were to close it would be a permanent decision as
the building would then be sold. If the Chapel is to remain open, then it needs
more people to attend the weekly services on
a regular basis.

If you are not sure, then please come along to
one of our Sunday Services before you make
up your mind. There is a service every
Sunday at 2.30pm. You are assured of a very
warm welcome in a friendly environment.

The Chapel is heated and has toilet facilities.

WE LOOK FORWARD TO SEEING YOU SOON.
