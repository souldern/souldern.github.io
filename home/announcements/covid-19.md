### Wrightons Fritwell

So, launching today in advance of the instructions for the elderly and
vulnerable to self isolate for weeks, Wrightons in Fritwell are
beginning an emergency supplies system for neighbours in the village
to help those who cannot get out.

Please visit the Wrightons website
to find the current order form. [wrightons.co.uk](https://www.wrightons.co.uk)

Please
note, Wrightons are not delivering. They will prepare shopping orders
to their best ability using available supplies on two days a
week. Orders will be totalled, and calls made to collect payment via
debit / credit card.

If you know someone who cannot, or will not
leave the house, and needs help, then please introduce yourself and
offer your support.  Please help each other in this time of
need. Please try to make sure you help neighbours who you know
personally.

themselves stuck at home to be able to get out in the garden and get
some fresh air which is important to maintain physical and mental
health. We have therefore enlarged our local delivery service and
reduced the costs. We are able to deliver anything in the Garden
Centre - from plants and composts, gifts and items in our food hall
(including jams, biscuits, eggs, meat and our home cooked frozen
meals).  To place an order, please call: 01280 822133
