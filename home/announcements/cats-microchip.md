# Cherwell Cats Protection Launches £5 Microchipping Scheme In Banbury

Cherwell Cats Protection, which covers Banbury, Bicester, Brackley and Kidlington, has
teamed up with three (3) veterinary practices in Banbury to launch a £5 cat microchipping
scheme, to run throughout the month of October 2020.

Micro chipping, which involves a small data chip being inserted under the cat’s skin, is a safe
and permanent way to identify a cat. There is no minimum age to microchip a cat and unlike
collars, microchips don't come off. As long as the cat's details are in the national database,
owners have peace of mind knowing they are more likely to be reunited with their pet cat
should it ever go missing.

Thanks to this special offer, cat owners can have their pets chipped at participating veterinary
clinics for only £5 per cat compared to the usual £12 to £15 it normally costs. This is less
than half price and incredible value.

The participating veterinary practices teaming up with Cherwell Cats Protection for this
scheme are Hawthorne Lodge Vets (Banbury), Vets4Pets (Banbury), and West Bar Vets
(Banbury). All chipping must be completed between October 1st – October 31st.


<b><i>To have your cat micro chipped, please call the vets directly for an appointment,
referencing Cherwell Cats Protection micro chipping scheme.</i></b>

Pet owners must live in postcode(s) – OX5, OX15, OX16, OX17, OX25, OX26, OX27 or
NN13 to be eligible.

In addition to the October micro chipping scheme, Cherwell Cats Protection continues to
operate a voucher scheme for those who need help with the cost of neutering their cats. The
scheme is means tested and is available only to those who live in the post code areas listed
above.
