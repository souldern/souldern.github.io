<div><p>Nicholas Johnstone and  Christine Kane contacted the website with the following offer:<br /></p> <blockquote>Hello<br /><br />We
 moved into Fox Hollies, Foxhill Lane in January and are very much 
enjoying living in this beautiful and friendly village. <br /><br />We inherited a pond stocked with koi carp and
 goldfish. We have had the pond extensively  refurbished but there are 
rather too many goldfish. We shall be happy to give some <b>goldfish</b>, <b>free of charge</b>, to
 someone local with a suitable pond.<br /></blockquote></div><div> Nicholas may be contacted on 07771 757018</div>
