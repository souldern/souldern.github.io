The scheme involves upgrading the A43 Padbury roundabout to improve
the safety of the slip road and increase its capacity. This should
also help to prepare the junction as planned housing is developed in
the area.

## The work will involve:

 *  widening the existing nearside M40 Junction 10 southbound off slip on the immediate approach to the roundabout to accommodate three running lanes
 *  and changing the junction to have all approaches controlled by smart traffic signals.


##Timescales

We expect to start construction in August 2024 and finish in Spring 2025.

The start of work has been delayed by the unexpected presence of Great Crested Newts on site and the legal requirement to monitor their numbers.

 
## What you can expect

The southbound slip approach road of the M40 will be closed every weekday night between 9.30pm and 6am. Drivers will be diverted to junction nine and back.

The A43 will also need to be closed periodically overnight, with confirmed dates available on the National Highways and county council websites nearer the time.

During all road closures, fully signed diversion routes will be put in place. All carriageways will be open as usual outside our working hours. 

We will not close the road during any major events in the area and will ensure that access to businesses and residences is maintained wherever possible.
