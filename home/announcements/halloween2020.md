# Halloween


Souldern is planning a Covid-friendly trick or treat event for Halloween.

 * Souldern Kids of all ages are invited to participate in a Halloween treasure hunt
round the village before collecting a suitably hygienic swag bag from the Fox.

* If you'd like to be a "sticker stop" on the hunt, then we'll need your
house name/number. We ask for a Â£5 donation from these households to
cover the cost of the goodie bags.

* If you have children who'd like to participate, then we'll want names
and a parental contact number (none of which will be made public) to
register and help us to manage numbers. Kids participate free.

* For further details join the
[Spooktacular Souldern WhatsApp group](https://chat.whatsapp.com/LMzCdwBcE7B23uj1cgtLSJ)
or email [ben@manchester.com](mailto:ben@manchester.com)
