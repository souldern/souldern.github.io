<p>In general, the <b>Souldern Village</b> account should not be used
other than initial setup so that the site history logs the “real
people” who are editing.</p>

<h2 id="editing">Editing the Website</h2>
<p>In order to be able to edit the site you do need a
  <a href="https://github.com/join?source=header-home">GitHub
    account</a>.  Once you have a GitHub user
  name, <a href="/home/contact-website">Contact the site
    maintainers</a> and ask to be added to
  the <a href="https://github.com/orgs/souldern/people">Souldern
    GitHub Organisation</a> which will give you write access to the
  site.
</p>
<p>Unlike some other public website hosting solutions, GitHub pages
  gives total control over the HTML in the pages that are served.
  This does give a lot of flexibility however does make editing the site
  seem slightly more technical at first. We do however use the default
  <a href="https://help.github.com/articles/about-github-pages-and-jekyll/">Jekyll</a>
  site builder which means that you can post pages to the site without
  needing to know any HTML markup or have any software other than your
  normal web browser.</p>
<p>I will present different levels of editing instructions starting
with the simplest and getting more technical later. Many people will
only need the first level which will allow you to post announcement
pages which will appear on the site and be automatically linked from
  the home page announcements section.</p>
<dl>

  <dt>Posting a Markdown announcement via the website</dt>
  <dd><a href="simple-posting">Step by step instructions specific to this site.</a></dd>

  <dt>Uploading PDF, Word, Images, etc.</dt>
  <dd><a href="file-upload">Step by step file upload instructions.</a></dd>
  
  <dt>Posting HTML pages</dt>
  <dd><a href="html-posting">Using HTML rather than Markdown</a></dd>

  <dt>Using git and editing the files on your local machine</dt>
  <dd>The most flexible way to edit the files is to install the git
  source control system and edit the files on the local disk. Anyone
  interested in doing this is welcome to contact David Carlisle for
  tips. <a href="https://help.github.com/categories/github-pages-basics/">Github
  has copious documentation online.</a></dd>

<h2 id="licence">Licence</h2>
<p>As noted in the
<a href="/home/about">About</a>
page unless otherwise noted the text and images on this website are
Copyright Souldern Parish Council, and distributed under
a <a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/"
rel="nofollow">Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 4.0
International License</a>.</p>

<p><b>Note</b> this means that any contributing editors agree to
assign copyright to the Parish Council. Other licences would be
possible but the CC licences are a standard and well tested licence
for this kind of use.</p>
<p>It is highly recommended that <i>some</i> licence is used, to avoid
problems with future edits to the text and general distribution
issues. Care should be taken that any photographs obtained from the
web should be compatible with this. Often this is not a problem even
if the original is available in a more restrictive form, for example
the 100th anniversary picture of a <a href="/history/transport">steam
train on the viaduct</a> was marked as “All rights reserved” which
would prevent use on this site, however I mailed the author requesting
permission and got a reply back the same day, a copy of which is in
the <b>Souldern Village</b> gmail for the record. Similarly permission
was requested and granted for the image of the pond in the site
banner, again forwarded to the gmail account.</p>

<h2 id="calendar">Editing the Calendar</h2>
<p>Access to the calendar is handled separately to access to the
website, anyone with Owner access to the calendar can “share” the
calendar with another user via email from the “settings” page. Note as
well as being available on the site if you use the button under the
calendar the calendar may be imported into most calendar apps, eg on
mobile phones, etc.</p>

<h3 id="photos">Photographs and Slideshows</h3>
<p>... to be updated ...</p>

<h2 id="twitter">Twitter</h2>
<p>The twitter have disabled the ability to having embeded search widgets, however there are still
  gadgets following <b>@3parishesnews</b> and<b>@CherwellOnline</b> twitter profiles are on the <a href="/home/three-parishes">Three Parishes</a>&nbsp; and <a href="/parish-council/cherwell-dc-and-mps">CDC</a> pages.</p>


<h2 id="contact">Contact Form</h2>

<p>As a matter of policy I have avoided putting most emails on the
website as plain text. The main exception being emails to
the <b>souldern.org</b> domain (if these get affected by spam mail we
can discard them and allocate new addresses without affecting people's
main email accounts).</p>

<p>As well as the general “Contact” link under the home page, several
pages such as Village hall booking, Ann's Book banner in the history
page and the Community market page use a link to the contact form as
an alternative to direct email to the relevant person. All messages
sent by the form are recorded in a spreadsheet in the Souldern Village
Drive account, and that spreadsheet then sends an email
to <b>souldern.website [at] gmail.com</b> email account. That gmail account
is in turn set up to forward currently to David Carlisle and Nick
Oakhill's email, but other email addresses could be added. For
simplicity just one email form is used across the site although if
needed individual forms could be set up to mail direct to different
individuals.</p>
<p>The form is actually backed up by a spreadsheet stored in
the <b>Souldern Village</b> Google Drive account. All responses are entered
into that spreadsheet. A script on the spreadsheet then forwards the
response to <b>souldern.website [at] gmail.com</b>.</p>

<h2 id="email">Email</h2>
<p>The GoDaddy registration of the <b>souldern.org</b> domain gives
access to 100 email forwarding accounts. This is managed by Nick
Oakhill as the domain owner. No email is stored on GoDaddy
or <b>souldern.org</b> servers but we can specify for each of 100
addresses of the form <tt>abc [at] souldern.org</tt> one or more “real”
email accounts to which the email should be forwarded. (This can be
any convenient email service such as gmail or btinternet or email
provided by your employer, etc.)</p>
<p>At the current time the following email addresses are enabled at <b>souldern.org</b>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Admin [at] souldern.org</li>
<li>DavidCarlisle [at] souldern.org</li>
<li>KatyDraper [at] souldern.org</li>
<li>NickOakhill [at] souldern.org</li>
<li>NikkiRobertson [at] souldern.org</li>
<li>RobLarge [at] souldern.org</li>
<li>Tania [at] souldern.org</li>
<li>ParishClerk [at] souldern.org</li>
<li>SouldernFC [at] souldern.org</li>
<li>SUC [at] souldern.org</li>
<li>VillageHall [at] souldern.org</li>
<li>Website [at] souldern.org</li>
</ul>
<p>The names have been written camel case here to make them easier to read but email addresses are always case insensitive, so <tt>davidcarlisle [at] souldern.org</tt> would also work. The <b>Website [at] souldern.org</b> address is equivalent to using the form on the site, and goes to the <b>souldern.website [at] gmail.com</b> account, which in turn forwards to (currently) David Carlisle and Nick Oakhill.
</p>
<p>As a matter of policy we have avoided putting any email addresses on site other than <b>souldern.org</b> domain addresses, so if you are representing a local organisation and wish a contact address be added to the site, you should obtain a <b>souldern.org</b> address, or use the contact form (in which case any relevant messages will be forwarded to you by the site maintainer).</p>

<h2 id="drive">Google Sheets (Drive)</h2>
<p>As well as being used to save file space on the website account, the Drive (google docs) features are used to enhance the site in other ways. As noted above a spreadsheet is used to power the <a href="/home/contact-website">contact form</a> for example.</p>
