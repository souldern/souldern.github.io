<h2 id="accounts">Account details</h2>

<p>In general, the <b>Souldern Village</b> account should not be used
other than initial setup so that the site history logs the “real
people” who are editing.</p>

<h2 id="editing">Editing the Website</h2>
<p><p>In order to be able to edit the site you do need a
  <a href="https://github.com/join?source=header-home">GitHub
  account</a>.  Once you have a GitHub user
  name, <a href="/home/contact-website">Contact the site
  maintainers</a> and ask to be added to
  the <a href="https://github.com/orgs/souldern/people">Souldern
  GitHub Organisation</a> which will give you write access to the
  site.
</p>

<h2 id="licence">Licence</h2>
<p>As noted in the
public <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/souldernuk/home/about">About</a>
page unless otherwise noted the text and images on this website are
Copyright Souldern Parish Council, and distributed under
a <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/"
rel="nofollow">Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 4.0
International License</a>.</p>

<p><b>Note</b> this means that any contributing editors agree to
assign copyright to the Parish Council. Other licences would be
possible but the CC licences are a standard and well tested licence
for this kind of use. it is highly recommended that <i>some</i>
licence is used, to avoid problems with future edits to the text and
general distribution issues. Care should be taken that any photographs
obtained from the web should be compatible with this. Often this is
not a problem even if the original is available in a more restrictive
form, for example the 100th anniversary picture of
a <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/souldernuk/history/transport">steam
train on the viaduct</a> was marked as “All rights reserved” which
would prevent use on this site, however I mailed the author requesting
permission and got a reply back the same day, a copy of which is in
the <b>Souldern Village</b> gmail for the record. Similarly permission
was requested and granted for the image of the pond in the site
banner, again forwarded to the gmail account.</p>

<h2 id="calendar">Editing the Calendar</h2>
<p>Access to the calendar is handled separately to access to the
website, anyone with Owner access to the calendar can “share” the
calendar with another user via email from the “settings” page. Note as
well as being available on the site if you use the button under the
calendar the calendar may be imported into most calendar apps, eg on
mobile phones, etc.</p>

<h3 id="photos">Photographs and Slideshows</h3>

<p>The original version of
the <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/souldernuk/village-hall">
village hall picture </a> was 10MB in size, that That is: one image
doubled the file usage of the whole site at that time!</p>

<p>After uploading to the Google photo sharing site with the account setting
“high” resolution giving unlimited storage space, the file size was
reduced to 4MB.</p>


<p>Both of these versions are still way beyond what is needed for
a web site and are not actually the versions a reader sees, as the google server serves much
smaller images depending on the requested size, In this case the
browser reports</p>
<pre>https://sites.google.com/site/souldernuk/_/rsrc/1443475151045/
    village-hall/1114.JPG?height=213&amp;width=320
20.01 KB (20,490 bytes)
</pre>

<p>So the file actually seen by the reader of the site is 0.02MB in
size, so any theoretical loss of quality in the photo site storing a
4MB version rather than the original 10MB is dwarfed by the file
reduction needed to make a web page display quickly. More importantly
the 4MB version accounts for 0% of the site file quota.</p>

<p>However it is still recommended that the site site image upload is
used initially rather than multiple people using the administrative
Google Village account.</p>

<p>An alternative would be that individual editors upload photos to their
own photo sharing accounts. This would have similar effect of not
using up the site file quota, but would potentially fragment the site
content making it harder to be sure that it was all under the village
control as editors come and go.</p>

<p>Any images that are taken off the site will be re-added to the public
gallery owned by the <b>Souldern Village </b>account.<br>
<a href="https://picasaweb.google.com/111338960776702858271/SouldernWebsite">https://picasaweb.google.com/111338960776702858271/SouldernWebsite</a><br>
from there individual images can be re-added back to the site using
the normal "insert image" dialog but using the web address of the
picture rather than file upload.

<h2 id="twitter">Twitter</h2>
<p>The twitter have disabled the ability to having embeded search widgets, however there are still
  gadgets following <b>@3parishesnews</b> and<b>@CherwellOnline</b> twitter profiles are on the <a href="/home/three-parishes">Three Parishes</a>&nbsp; and <a href="/parish-council/cherwell-dc-and-mps">CDC</a> pages.</p>


<h2 id="contact">Contact Form</h2>

<p>As a matter of policy I have avoided putting most emails on the
website as plain text. The main exception being emails to
the <b>souldern.org</b> domain (if these get affected by spam mail we
can discard them and allocate new addresses without affecting people's
main email accounts).</p>

<p>As well as the general “Contact” link under the home page, several
pages such as Village hall booking, Ann's Book banner in the history
page and the Community market page use a link to the contact form as
an alternative to direct email to the relevant person. All messages
sent by the form are recorded in a spreadsheet in the Souldern Village
Drive account, and that spreadsheet then sends an email
to <b>souldern.website [at] gmail.com</b> email account. That gmail account
is in turn set up to forward currently to David Carlisle and Nick
Oakhill's email, but other email addresses could be added. For
simplicity just one email form is used across the site although if
needed individual forms could be set up to mail direct to different
individuals.</p>
<p>The form is actually backed up by a spreadsheet stored in
the <b>Souldern Village</b> Google Drive account. All responses are entered
into that spreadsheet. A script on the spreadsheet then forwards the
response to <b>souldern.website [at] gmail.com</b>.</p>

<h2 id="email">Email</h2>
<p>The GoDaddy registration of the <b>souldern.org</b> domain gives
access to 100 email forwarding accounts. This is managed by Nick
Oakhill as the domain owner. No email is stored on GoDaddy
or <b>souldern.org</b> servers but we can specify for each of 100
addresses of the form <tt>abc [at] souldern.org</tt> one or more “real”
email accounts to which the email should be forwarded. (This can be
any convenient email service such as gmail or btinternet or email
provided by your employer, etc.)</p>
<p>At the current time the following email addresses are enabled at <b>souldern.org</b>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Admin [at] souldern.org</li>
<li>DavidCarlisle [at] souldern.org</li>
<li>KatyDraper [at] souldern.org</li>
<li>NickOakhill [at] souldern.org</li>
<li>NikkiRobertson [at] souldern.org</li>
<li>RobLarge [at] souldern.org</li>
<li>Tania [at] souldern.org</li>
<li>ParishClerk [at] souldern.org</li>
<li>SouldernFC [at] souldern.org</li>
<li>SUC [at] souldern.org</li>
<li>VillageHall [at] souldern.org</li>
<li>Website [at] souldern.org</li>
</ul>
<p>The names have been written camel case here to make them easier to read but email addresses are always case insensitive, so <tt>davidcarlisle [at] souldern.org</tt> would also work. The <b>Website [at] souldern.org</b> address is equivalent to using the form on the site, and goes to the <b>souldern.website [at] gmail.com</b> account, which in turn forwards to (currently) David Carlisle and Nick Oakhill.
</p>
<p>As a matter of policy we have avoided putting any email addresses on site other than <b>souldern.org</b> domain addresses, so if you are representing a local organisation and wish a contact address be added to the site, you should obtain a <b>souldern.org</b> address, or use the contact form (in which case any relevant messages will be forwarded to you by the site maintainer).</p>

<h2 id="drive">Google Sheets (Drive)</h2>
<p>As well as being used to save file space on the website account, the Drive (google docs) features are used to enhance the site in other ways. As noted above a spreadsheet is used to power the <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/souldernuk/home/contact-website">contact form</a> for example.</p>
