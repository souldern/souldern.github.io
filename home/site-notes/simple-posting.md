# Posting a Simple Announcement

## GitHub Account

In order to be able to edit the site you do need a
  [GitHub account](https://github.com/join?source=header-home).
  Once you have a GitHub user
  name, [Contact the site  maintainers](/home/contact-website)
  and ask to be added to
  the [Souldern GitHub Organisation](https://github.com/orgs/souldern/people)
  which will give you write access to the site.
  
## First Post
In your web browser go to

[https://github.com/souldern/souldern.github.io/tree/master/home/announcements](https://github.com/souldern/souldern.github.io/tree/master/home/announcements)

Log in to GitHub if you are not already logged in and click on the **Create New File** button
which will open

[https://github.com/souldern/souldern.github.io/new/master/home/announcements](https://github.com/souldern/souldern.github.io/new/master/home/announcements)

with a blank new announcement.

1. Set a filename ending with `.md` in the small text box following `souldern.github.io/home/announcements/`
  for example `YingYang in Village hall.md`

2. In the main text box for the post add the date (yyy-mm-dd)  and title so that it looks like
