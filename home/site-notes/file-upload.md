# Uploading files

If you have followd the steps in [Posting a Simple Announcement](simple-posting),
then uploading files is very simple.

Navigate in the web interface to the required folder, for example

https://github.com/souldern/souldern.github.io/tree/master/parish-church

Then use the **Upload Files** button and drag and drop the required
files into the upload box then **Commit** as usual.

For security reasons there are some restrictions on the file types
that may be uploaded via the web. If there is a special file that needs
to be uploaded contact David Carlisle, any file may be uploaded via
the commandline interface not discussed in these pages.


**For high resolution photographs it is better to use the Google Photo
Server which will handle serving suitable files for the device being
used, However it is often convenient to upload small "web quality"
images at the same time as the main text page.**

To refer to an image uploaded to this site use: 

`![local image](../event-2018/wacky2018.png)`

![local image](../event-2018/wacky2018.png)

To refer to an image in Google Photos, get a "get link" from the share
menu in the Photos site, then use on this site in the same way:
