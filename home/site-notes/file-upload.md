## Uploading files

If you have followed the steps in [Posting a Simple Announcement](simple-posting),
then uploading files is very simple.

Navigate in the web interface to the required folder, for example

[https://github.com/souldern/souldern.github.io/tree/master/parish-church](https://github.com/souldern/souldern.github.io/tree/master/parish-church)

Then use the **Upload Files** button and drag and drop the required
files into the upload box then **Commit** as usual.

For security reasons there are some restrictions on the file types
that may be uploaded via the web. If there is a special file that needs
to be uploaded contact David Carlisle, any file may be uploaded via
the commandline interface not discussed in these pages.


One-off files that are linked from announcements etc may have any
filename, but regular series of files that are posted are best named
such that they list in date order automatically. Naming the files this way allows automatic links to the
latest files to be generated. See for example the [Newsletter](https://github.com/souldern/souldern.github.io/tree/master/parish-council/spc-newsletter) and [Parish Council Minutes](https://github.com/souldern/souldern.github.io/tree/master/parish-council/spc-minutes) directories.

**For high resolution photographs it is better to use the Google Photo
Server which will handle serving suitable files for the device being
used, However it is often convenient to upload small "web quality"
images at the same time as the main text page.**

To refer to an image uploaded to this site use: 

`![local image](/home/events/event-2016/wacky-logo.png)`

![local image](/home/events/event-2016/wacky-logo.png)

To refer to an image in Google Photos, get a "get link" from the share
menu in the Photos site, Follow that link to get the (long)  URL to the image
then use on this site in the same way as a local link:

`![Google Photo image](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/5WMFU9rtNiLbw45jEe4XlR9tTk....)`

If you have several images it is better (and simpler) to make an _Album_ in google photos and then make a slideshow,
[see the examples on the gallery page](/home/gallery).
