If an emergency arises and you need to use the device, phone the
Ambulance Service via 999 and they will give you the access code to
open the case to the defibrilator. The machine itself will give spoken
instructions and lead you through the process of applying the device
to the patient and applying CPR if necessary.


If you wish to familiarize yourself with the operation of the
defibriliator the following video should help.  The model installed is
the **Powerheart G5 Semi Automatic with CPR Feedback**
