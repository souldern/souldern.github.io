<h2 id="TOC-Introduction">Introduction</h2>

<p>The <b>Souldern Village
Website</b> was set up at the suggestion of Souldern Parish
Council. Initially (September 2015 &ndash; October 2018) the hosting
arrangement was at google sites. Currently the site is hosted at github
pages.  The initial design and most initial content has been provided
by David Carlisle, however as described below, it should be seen as a
village resource and <a href="/home/contact-website">contributions</a>
are welcome.</p>

<h2 id="TOC-Credits">Credits</h2>

<ul>

<li>The <a href="/recreational-areas/footpaths">Footpath map</a> uses
a map originally using OpenStreetMap data, but with extensive
additions to the footpaths, and interactive behaviour added by David
Carlisle.</li>
<li>The poem which is occasionally used on the home page is quoted from
Robert Hitchman's book “From the Turnpike”.</li>
<li>The collage of village photographs sometimes used as a site banner
is made from freely available images, and images used with permission
from <a href="http://www.erniesplace.com/TBN/_BoatingDiaries/090400_Apr/Diaries/090413_Aynho.shtml"
rel="nofollow">Ernie Williams</a>, Some images from that site are also
in the <a href="/home/gallery">Gallery</a>.</li>
<li>Many of the historical black and white photographs are taken with
permission from Ann Prescott's book, “<b>Souldern</b> our village in
Oxfordshire”, Much of the text in the overview of the historical
section is also derived from this book, Ann having kindly supplied the
book sources in electronic form to the site
editors. <a href="/history">This book is still available</a>, with
proceeds going to Village institutions.
</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="TOC-Photographs">Photographs</h2>

<p>As the site contains photographs of the Village and the Village
Events, it may naturally include photographs of people connected with
the village. If you object to any particular photograph being
included, or object to any photograph of yourself or your dependents
being included, please <a href="/home/contact-website">contact the
editors</a> and we will remove any problematic images, and try to
ensure that any listed people are not included in general photographs
added to the site.</p>

<h2 id="TOC-Cookies">Cookies</h2>

<p>The website editors have not directly written any code to set or
use any data in “cookies” (small pieces of information stored locally
by your web browser) however the google analytics
  infrastructure does use cookies.
  European law requires that users are informed of this
fact. The site will put up a banner for you to accept the use of
cookies. It is only shown the first time you visit the site (unless
you clear your browser's cached cookies).</p>

<h2 id="TOC-Contributions">Contributions</h2>

<p>Contributions are welcome!</p>

<p>You may send in comments via
the <a href="/home/contact-website">comment form</a>,
email <a href="mailto:website@souldern.org">website@souldern.org</a>,
or just stop us in the street. Comments may be of any nature,
corrections to the site, suggestions for future additions, or
contributions of whole pages. The comment form just takes simple email
text, but once contact is made, contributions can be of any form,
plain text, HTML (Web) documents, Word files, PDF, pictures, etc. they
may be uploaded as files, or converted to site pages by the site
editors, as appropriate.</p>
<p>If you find yourself wanting to make regular contributions, for
example regular updates for sports results, or society meetings etc,
then you could ask to become an editor of the relevant part of the
site.</p>

<!--
<h2 id="TOC-Twitter">Twitter</h2>
<p>One particularly easy way to contribute to the site if you
use <b>twitter</b> is to tweet any message containing the
tag <b>#Souldern</b> and it will appear in the twitter search page
linked from the home page.</p>
-->

<h2 id="TOC-Calendar">Calendar</h2>
<p>The <a href="/home/calendar">calendar</a> appears on its own page
and also in abbreviated form on the home page. Also the calendar is
exported in a form that may be used with calendar apps in mobile
phones and similar devices, so you can keep up to date without
visiting the site at all. If you have regular or a one-off event that
you would like adding to the calendar, contact the editors via
the <a href="/home/contact-website">web form</a>.</p>

<h2 id="TOC-Editors">Editors</h2>
<p>Github Pages (like the previous plaform, Google sites) was chosen
as the hosting platform partly as it is free, but mainly as it offers
a very easy interface requiring no extra software other than a web
browser, hopefully this will mean that the site can easily be passed
between different maintainers and it is not "locked" to software just
available to a few residents.</p>
<p>In order to be able to edit the site you do need a
  <a href="https://github.com/join?source=header-home">GitHub account</a>
which is used to handle the access control. Initially at least, we do not
expect too many people to have edit access, however contributions of
photographs or other information about the village are welcome.</p>
<p>If you do have edit rights to the site, there are further details
on the <a href="/home/site-notes/">Site Notes</a> page.</p>
