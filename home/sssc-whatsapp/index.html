Hi, just wondering if anyone knows somebody in the Village who's up for a bit of occasional hourly paid labouring ? Bit of experience in building trade would be helpful but not necessary. <br>
Might be good idea to have a local community 'trust a trader' list for any skills that people can help with occasionally from gardening to computer help or just being able to give a lift to Banbury or Bicester for instance....

There are two men in Fritwell “selling” loft insulation. One is wearing sunglasses currently - very pushy in trying to enter properties to inspect lifts. Call the police if you encounter these characters. Possibly linked to burglaries in Ardley yesterday.

Hello all<br>

<br>
Friends of Fritwell School are looking ahead to the (hopefully) nicer weather and planning their big summer event. We are looking for local businesses to sponsor elements of the event in return for advertising in the local community and at the event. It’s a high attendance event and we have many avenues for advertising and a variety of packages available.
<br>

<br>
If anyone would be interested in being involved or could put me in touch with someone I would be very grateful.
<br>

<br>

In case you’ve not seen advice to stay at home and self isolate if you have a persistant cough or fever. Also applies to children. Happy to fetch supplies or offer any other help. <br>

Hi, for anyone who is not aware, there is a milkman   delivering to Souldern three times a week, Tuesday, Thursday and Saturday. He not only delivers milk but you can order a whole range of groceries including bread, cheese, eggs, juice, fruit and veg, vegan, dairy free, household and garden items. Set up an account online and you can order online or on their app up until 9pm the night before for delivery by 7am. Delivery is free. Go to milkandmore.co.uk<br>
Hope this is of help to some people.

Good afternoon all, As the COVID 19 situation is moving very swiftly, as a community we need to pull together and offer assistance where it is needed in the village, particularly to those who are most vulnerable. Can we all take the time to think of any of our neighbours who might fall into this category. Then visit them, if you are willing, or alternatively let us know as there are many in this group who have offered assistance. Let’s identify the areas where help maybe needed and then we can galvanise the troops as required. <br>
Regards
<br>
Nick

Just awaiting a copy of the electoral roll to use as a starting point. For obvious reasons we need to be sensitive to the fact that some will not wish to be seen as vulnerable!! So have to be careful to handle with tact( not a strength of mine).

it seems quite likely according to BBC that everyone over 70 will be asked to self isolate so the definition of those that are "vulnerable" may need to be simply that: a list of households with over 70s

UK Virus ALERT<br>

<br>
The English are feeling the pinch in relation to recent virus threat and have therefore raised their threat level from “Miffed” to “Peeved.” Soon, though, level may be raised yet again to “Irritated” or even “A Bit Cross.”
<br>

<br>
The English have not been “A Bit Cross” since the blitz in 1940 when tea supplies nearly ran out.
<br>

<br>
The virus has been re-categorized from “Tiresome” to “A Bloody Nuisance.” The last time the British issued a “Bloody Nuisance” warning level was in 1588, when threatened by the Spanish Armada.
<br>

<br>
The Scots have raised their threat level from “Pissed Off” to “Let's Get the Bastard.” They don't have any other levels. This is the reason they have been used on the front line of the British army for the last 300 years.
<br>

<br>
The French government announced yesterday that it has raised its alert level from “Run” to “Hide.” The only two higher levels in France are “Collaborate” and “Surrender.” The rise was precipitated by a recent fire that destroyed France's white flag factory, effectively paralyzing the country's military capability.
<br>

<br>
Italy has increased the alert level from “Shout Loudly and Excitedly” to “Elaborate Military Posturing.” Two more levels remain: “Ineffective Combat Operations” and “Change Sides.”
<br>

<br>
The Germans have increased their alert state from “Disdainful Arrogance” to “Dress in Uniform and Sing Marching Songs.” They also have two higher levels: “Invade a Neighbour” and “Lose.”
<br>

<br>
Belgians, on the other hand, are all on holiday as usual; the only threat they are worried about is NATO pulling out of Brussels.
<br>

<br>
The Spanish are all excited to see their new submarines ready to deploy. These beautifully designed subs have glass bottoms so the new Spanish navy can get a really good look at the old Spanish navy.
<br>

<br>
Australia, meanwhile, has raised its alert level from “No worries” to “She'll be alright, Mate.” Two more escalation levels remain: “Crikey! I think we'll need to cancel the barbie this weekend!” and “The barbie is cancelled.” So far, no situation has ever warranted use of the final escalation level.
<br>

The Russians have said “Its not us”

Losing business is not going to help anyone. Stress and Depression will hit harder than the virus if people don't think rationally. People are worried about a virus that we've probably had around since before Christmas, some of us have possibly already had it. Just isolate if you're ill and stay away from elderly relatives until clear. ♥️🙏

Sad to hear about businesses going under and agree important not to panic. Here’s a summary of PHE guidance.<br>
- If you have persistant cough or fever self isolate for 7 days. 
<br>
- Whole household self isolate for 14 days from the day the first person had symptoms if anyone  in family has persistant cough or fever
<br>
- If in your household you have person >70 years, someone with long term condition, pregnant or immunocompromised person try to find somewhere else for them to stay. 
<br>
- Various sensible social distancing measures based on experience in Italy and most recent robust modelling. Up to 50,000 cases in UK. That’s only 0.08% population so far. Hospitals already busy, so important to follow advice for the good of all. 
<br>
I’ve attached social distancing measures and information about those considered high risk. Hope you all stay well. Dr Lucy x

FYI<br>
(As I received)
<br>
 Dr..  Hussam Hijazi: "The latest information from the University of Vienna, Research Department, today March 14, 2020: Please tell all people who have symptoms or fear of corona when they get headache, severe headache, throat infections coughing or heat occurs. Do not take Ibuprofen because it has been discovered that it increases speed  The reproduction of the coronavirus covid-19 in the body and this is the reason why people in Italy have reached the current bad stage and rapid spread - the best in this case paracetamol or aspirin - please distribute the message to all those you know to save them from this disease/crisis.
<br>

<br>
 At the university hospital in Toulouse, France, there are four very critical cases of coronavirus in people of young age 18 / 24 and 32 who do not have any health problem.  Their problem is that when they all appeared to have symptoms, they all took painkillers like (... ibuprofen, voltaren, profenid) and other relievers containing cortisone.
<br>
 As a precaution, you should avoid these medications for anyone who develops symptoms. You should always consult a doctor.
<br>
 The French authorities began to spread this information widely.

Fritwell School have sadly had to cancel their Easter Egg hunt for this year... this will mean less contribution from the PTA to the school fund. <br>
To try and re-coup some losses we are selling off the eggs we had purchased in preparation, if anyone would like to purchase any please send me a PM. I can deliver and leave on doorsteps if you are self isolating. They are £1 for a larger egg and 50p for small ones which should be a little cheaper than the shops are currently selling for. Thanks!
