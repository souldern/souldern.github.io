# Cauliflower Cheese Soup (Caroline Sartory)

Instead of boiling the cauliflower, I roasted it for 30 mins with a
couple of cloves of garlic.

>   **Ingredients**
>
>    knob of butter
>
>    1 large onion, finely chopped
>    
>    1 large cauliflower (about 900g/2lb), leaves trimmed and cut into florets
>    
>    1 potato, peeled and cut into chunks
>    
>    700ml vegetable stock (from a cube is fine)
>
>    400ml milk
>
>    100g mature cheddar, diced
>
>    **Method**
>
>    Heat the butter in a large saucepan. Tip in the onion and cook
>    until softened, about 5 mins, stirring often. Add the cauliflower,
>    potato, stock, milk and seasoning. Bring to the boil, then reduce
>    the heat and leave to simmer for about 30 mins until the
>    cauliflower is soft and the potato almost collapsing.
>
>    Whizz in a food processor or crush with a potato masher until you
>    get a creamy, thick soup. Top up with more milk to thin a little
>    if serving in mugs. You can make ahead up to 2 days in advance,
>    cool, cover and leave in the fridge until needed, or freeze for up
>    to 1 month. When ready to serve, warm through, ladle into mugs or
>    bowls, top with the cheese pieces, then stir through before
>    eating.
