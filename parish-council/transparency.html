<p>The introduction to the Transparency code gives background to the new rules, 
explaining that the information is made available to give you a chance to
scrutinize the council activities, replacing the previous requirement for an external audit of the accounts.
The following list is quoted from the code:</p>
<ol style="font-size:90%">
<li>
This Code is issued to meet the Government’s desire to place more power 
into citizens’ hands to increase democratic accountability. Transparency gives 
local people the tools and information they need to
hold local public bodies to account.</li>
<li>
The Local Audit and Accountability Act 2014 sets out a new audit framework 
for local public authorities which are currently covered by the Audit 
Commission regime. Under the new audit framework smaller authorities, 
including parish councils, […], with an annual turnover not exceeding £25,000 will be 
exempt from routine external audit. In place of routine audit, these smaller 
authorities will be subject 
to the new transparency requirements laid out in this 
Code. This will enable local electors and ratepayers to access relevant 
information about the authorities’ accounts and governance.</li>
<li>The Government considers that publication of the items in this Code will 
provide the local electorate and ratepayers with a clear picture of the activities 
of these smaller authorities[…]</li>
