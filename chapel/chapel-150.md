# Souldern 150 years

In one respect celebrating an anniversary such as this is like celebrating the
New Year.

It finds us doing something which some may say is hard to do – To look

both ways at the same time.

Yes, we look back at years past & we try to look forward to what may lie
ahead.

As we look back, we have memories of many years spent in this place.
When I first began to think of this evening, I had a feeling of being
depressed.

It took some getting around to realise that all but 1 year I have been
associated with this Chapel half of those 150 yrs. I sat with my thoughts &
could picture many faces of those who have passed onto glory.
In the pictures that came into my mind I could see the many families that
occupied the pews in those past days. Indeed, there was a family in most
seats, & I believe that in my day the majority of seats were occupied by
Reeve families.

The singing was something worth hearing, with the men putting in the base
parts etc.

The preachers to me as a youngster all seemed old men that would go on &
on. They would have many points & when it got to fourthly, we thought he
was nearing the end, but no it would continue & sometimes get to
seventhly, by then we had completely given up. We kids were expected to
sit & be quiet. It was seldom that a preacher ever said anything to us.

But there was one preacher who we were always eager to go & listen to,
but only because he finished at a quarter to seven. A 45-minute service, he
didn’t go on well over the hour. And that preacher continued coming to us
for many years, even when he had to be fetched & because the steps were
an obstacle, we sat him in a chair & lifted him up the steps & he sat to lead
our worship. This old gentleman got to a stage in his life where he found it
difficult to get around. I would fetch him & because of his walking
difficulties etc he was unable to put his shoes & socks on by himself & so I
would go a few minutes earlier allowing time for me to carry out this task
for him.

As I got older, I soon realised that these old local preachers had a deep faith
& preached from a personal experience.

It was because of one old local preacher that I am here tonight, I was 17 &
still attending services, BUT why. This old gentleman appeared to spend
the entire service talking to me. His theme was prayer. It was easy to tell
that he lived on prayer. I can hear him now saying “Don’t go home my boy
& pray for something & expect it to be on the doorstep with the milk
delivery tomorrow morning. But God will answer in His time but not
perhaps in the way you think best. How true he was but thro’ prayer God
showed me the way I should go & I have been a great believer in prayer
from that day.

What about the chapel itself? The Building.

As one got to the first step to come into the yard from the lane there on the
right-hand side, where the slabbed area is now, was a great yew bush that
covered the area that is now slabs. As youngsters we loved to hide in there,
but on dark nights we were afraid there may well be someone in there &
always hurried by.

The organ has always been the holy of holies. & was operated by one pedal
to fill the bellows with air, but many years back an electric blower was
fitted. This must be oiled several times each year. The job of oiling the
various parts was given to me. On one occasion after oiling it was found on
the Sunday that the bellows were not getting filled with air. I had put the oil
can back on the flap valve & so it was unable to lift allowing air to be drawn
in.

There was no outside light whatever & everyone left on a winter’s night in
complete darkness. And so being young & foolish I suggested at my second
attendance at a meeting of church members that we have an outside light
on the front of the building & I would be willing to fit one. Oh, dear what
eruptions. But after lots of discussion it was agreed to go ahead. I got home
wishing I had kept quiet. But two weeks after the light being fitted a few of
those that disagreed were heard to say “how did we manage without”

The heating of the building was by a solid fuel boiler & radiators, that was
in my day. I have no idea what preceded that. But this had to be lit early on
Sunday morning in readiness for Sunday school at 10-30. The old
gentleman that was steward & organist always took care of this. But when
we had the bad winter of 62 / 63 he asked after an evening service if there
was someone that would take over. Keeping the boiler going to keep the
frost out & the difficulty of getting down the lane was just becoming too
much for him.

I went home thinking I could do that. I can hear my Father saying
remember if you offer to take it on, its every week not just a one off. Well I
offered & took over responsibility of chief boiler man. But I wasn’t allowed
a key to the building. Each time I must go to the old gentleman & ask for the
key. If I couldn’t get on a Sat evening, then I had to wait until 8 o’clock on
Sunday morning when they were up. BUT (yes another but) then I found an
old key that fitted & so would come & light the boiler & get it going well &
then go & ask for the key. That was until I thought it was a fool’s game so
came clean & explained I had just found an old key that fitted.

Like everything else nothing lasts for ever & the boiler got old & needed
repair or replacement. It was decided to have electric heaters. How easy!
Only need to flick a switch on a Saturday & all was warm when Sunday
arrived.

Then of course there was no water. All water for whatever had to be
fetched from the village well. For any event that finished with a cuppa then
it was down to the well & bring back water to fill the old copper that was in
the shed that is now the toilet. And of course, there was a tank for feeding
water to the boiler & this had to be kept full.

When eventually we had the water laid on, we were able to have a toilet
and the small kitchen area.

In the chapel there were boards across the front where now there is a
communion rail.

Removal of those caused lots of debate. And the painting of the boards
behind the pulpit. Some of the older people were in favour others very
much against.

For some 20 years or so I was secretary of the Chapel & when we opened
up one weekend it had been raining in. And so, on the Monday morning I
had to get someone to look at the roof. On examination it was found that
the slates had rotted over the years & if you rubbed them with just your
fingers they would powder away. So, we needed an estimate to renew the
roof. If my memory serves me correctly it was for £6000. Where was this
to be found. There were only around eight members & all elderly, they
could not be expected to have a sponsored cycle ride to raise funds. We
prayed about this & during the next week a village resident (a church
warden) Major Grey came to see me & said he wished to help. Could we
supply him with names & hopefully addresses of people that had passed
through’ the Sunday school & Chapel. He would send out appeals for
donations to get us started on fund raising. He did this & cheques started to
roll in.

Another lady living in the village, Mrs Cotterill organised a coffee morning
& brought us £400. Six weeks from receiving the estimate we had the
money to go ahead. All we as a Church had done was pray about it.

When the roof was completed, we had a service of rededication, &
afterwards when the last cups of tea had been served the Electric failed. It
was definitely only the Chapel that had no electric. And so, on the Monday I
had to get an electrician in. The Church needed rewiring. And so again we
needed an estimate. The money left after the roof renewal was there in the
funds to the very last penny.

I can recall odd occasions when there were incidents that happened
making a laugh.

An old Couple visiting friends came to our afternoon service & sat with
these friends in a seat that was really only capable of taking three. Four was
a real squash, but they managed all tightly fitting together.
The old gentleman had glasses that he needed for reading & when he went
to put them on it could be seen that he had elastic from one arm of his specs
to the other & this he needed to get around the back of his head. Being so
tightly packed in the seat he was unable to get his arms high enough to do
this & so the elastic was only partly around his head. Being an old
gentleman, he was bald & very shiny on top & within seconds the specs
flew off as coming from a catapult. But the old lady having quick reactions
quickly shot her arm forward & grabbed them in mid-air. I had seen this &
laughed out loudly. Of course, everyone turned & looked at me, they had
not seen what I had witnessed.

One Sunday evening our preacher was enjoying a good sing. The hymn 317
in the Methodist Hymn book. Whosoever heareth shout shout the sound.
The chorus Whosoever will, whosoever will, send the proclamation over
vale & hill, Tis the loving Father calls the wanderer home, whosoever will
may come. Music means nothing to myself so I am in no position to argue
but our old gentlemen organist insisted there was a pause after whosoever
will, & so he looked up at our preacher & said pause. Our preacher looked
back at him & said praise the Lord brother he made the crows as well as the
canaries.

Another occasion our preacher got here & said O dear I have come without
my glasses. And our Lady organist at that time said can you see with mine,
He tried them and said they were perfect. She said well I can’t play without
them and he said I can’t preach without them, and so they spent the entire
time of the service handing this pair of specs to & fro’.

Then there was the old gentleman (who was a stickler for time). He kept a
close eye on the clock & when it got to the hour he would open & close his
spectacle case a few times & then give a loud sniff & out loudly would say
“whens he gonna finish”.

Then as I think & look back, I cannot forget the fact that there was always a
good Sunday school. In my day there were 27 to 30 children on a Sunday
morning. No chairs to sit comfy just benches with nothing to lean back
against.

There were two occasions each year that were the highlight, The Sunday
school anniversary & the outing to Wickstead park.
Anniversary days we had to look our best and put on our best behaviour.
For weeks beforehand we would practise recitations so that we could stand
out front & recite from memory.

I can recall one year’s recitation but sadly only the first verse. It said,
“Praise God for the morning I waken to find, a new day is dawning a chance
to be kind. No way does any of the other verses come to mind.

The outing to Wickstead Park at Kettering was a great occasion. And to us
in those by gone days was a long journey. There was always a stop off in
Northampton. And one year one old gentleman that came with us left the
market square in a different direction & was unable to find the coach.
Eventually he rolled up on the arm of a policeman.

He had asked the officer if he had seen any Souldern folk. Of course,
Wickstead Park was the farthest that many of us travelled in the year. To us
we were hundreds of miles from home.

So, its Church Anniversary, NOT just any anniversary but the 1 5 0 th.

It’s a time to thank God for the past & to look to the future. It’s a time to
celebrate the life & witness of not only this place of worship but also the life
& witness of those who have gone before. Those who not only built but also
made this their spiritual home.

Over the years many have worshiped & prayed in this place. WE ARE
STANDING ON HOLY GROUND. This is where our forefathers met, they may
have had a simple belief in Jesus, but they were people of GREAT FAITH.

A Church is nothing without people. Its PEOPLE that make the church.

If we all looked upon this place, we would all see something different. Some
would see certain families or individuals sitting in their pews. Memories
would come back of special occasions, some happy some sad.

My late wife & myself were married here.

Perhaps we would be reminded of a time when we encountered GOD &
recalled what great things he has done.

Perhaps as we look, we would say to ourselves, if it was me, I would
redesign this place.

How many pulpits for instance do we see these days?

We could look on the outside & think of the roll this place has played in this
community.

This is a place where we can find a peace & tranquillity a place we can rest
& talk with our maker. A place where perhaps we could encounter GOD
without even realising it.

This is a place where Gods love has been preached faithfully & seeds have
been sown for 150 years.

God has done some wonderful things through this church & so this is an
occasion to Praise & Thank God for many blessings.

At this time, we stand as it were at a Xrds, we stand & look as to where
things might go.

When our church at home (where I live now) closed, we had to say Mission
COMPLETE, it was a sad time.

A verse of scripture came to my mind whilst I was preparing this & I knew
straight away that this verse had been given me & so I must use it. That
verse is from Hebrews 12 & verse 2. LET US FIX OUR EYES ON JESUS, THE
AUTHOR & PERFECTER OF OUR FAITH.

Yes, we must look to Jesus & seek His guidance to what lies ahead.

What did the old Sankey Hymn say? GOD holds the key of all unknown & I
am Glad.

If other hands should hold the key or he had trusted it to me, I may be sad.

WE just PRAISE GOD for all that is past & we trust HIM for all that is to
come.
