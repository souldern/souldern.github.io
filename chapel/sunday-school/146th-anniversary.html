<p>On
Sunday 21<sup>st</sup> June 2015, Souldern Chapel and Sunday School celebrated their
146<sup>th</sup> Anniversary with guest preacher Pastor Andy Wilcock from
Sheffield.</p>
<p>In
the afternoon the chapel was almost full as the Sunday School children
celebrated with flowers, songs, recitations and musical solos. The eight pupils,
Matthew Carlisle, Lydia Glennon, Scott Jones, Sophia Large, William and Sophie
Noble, and Imogen and Ned Curry had worked hard to prepare and they gave an
impressive performance. The Sunday School is led by Mrs Audrey Westbury who has
been the teacher for the past 73 years (half of the total 146 years) and before
that was a pupil herself for 10 years! She was thanked for her continued hard
work and given flowers and a card by the children.</p>
<p>The
service was followed by a fantastic tea served in the school room and grateful
thanks go to all those who contributed to the lovely spread of food. The
flowers were taken to elderly and unwell people who were unable to attend the
service.</p>
<p>The
Chapel evening celebration, led by Pastor Wilcock was also well attended and
followed by yet more food.</p>
