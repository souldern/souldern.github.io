<p><b>Background</b></p>

<img style="float:right; width:50%" src="image345.jpg"/>
<p>In 1869 Mr James Cox, the owner of Spring House, donated a
small block of land at the bottom of his garden to a group of Wesleyan
Reformers who lived in the village. On this small parcel of land, a
Chapel was built that replaced the previous house of worship which is
now number 4 Chapel Row. For one hundred and fifty years, the Chapel
on Back Lane was used for services and Sunday School.</p>






<p>The last service was held in the Chapel in February 2019 and then
after another year of unsuccessfully trying to encourage increased
attendance, the painful decision was taken to close permanently from
April 2020.</p>

<hr/>

<p><b>The Opportunity</b> &mdash; The trustees of the Wesleyan Chapel are now going to
have to sell the building, which Souldern village is being given the
opportunity to buy at a preferential price. This offer is being made
in good faith on the condition that the building must be used for the
promotion of community wellbeing, village activities and social
gatherings. All proceeds from this sale will be returned to The
Wesleyan Reform Union of Churches for their central funds.</p>

<p>Following preliminary discussion with the Trustees, the village is
being given the time to put a plan together that will secure the
building for future generations. If collectively we do not act now,
the Chapel building will be sold to a third party.</p>

<p>Prior to the latest lockdown restrictions being imposed, the steering
group<sup>*</sup> had intended to invite all households within the parish to an
Open Morning (21st November) at the Chapel with a view to stimulating
everybody’s interest, ideas and buy-in to the project. Whilst it will
not be possible to do this as originally intended, it is hoped that
one day beyond lockdown this will be rearranged.</p>

<p><sup>*</sup> The steering group is a cross section of villagers
hoping to save the Chapel from being sold off externally and is open
to all interested parties.</p>

<p><b>If the opportunity is not seized now, there will not be a second chance.</b></p>


<h2>Reorganisation of two community assets and split of uses</h2>

<p>If collectively we have the appetite to purchase the Chapel, there
are three registered charities in the village under whose ownership
the Chapel could be placed:</p>
<ul>
<li>Souldern United Charity – managed by village trustees</li>
<li>St Mary’s Church – owned by the Church of England and
managed by the Parochial Church Council (villagers)</li>
<li>Souldern Village Hall – managed by village trustees</li>
</ul>

<p>In discussions to date, the steering group believe that the best
fit will be the Village Hall charity. It would allow two important
village buildings to be used in conjunction with one another to
support a wider variety of activities and uses. This would also avoid
conflict between the two buildings.</p>

<p><b>The Chapel</b>, being a smaller more intimate venue is better suited to
host fixed activities such as Sunday School, youth club, toddlers
group, sports and social club, occasional Chapel events and after
Church gatherings.</p>

<p>This option would also enable the Chapel to
become the new base for a permanent village reading room and to
establish a central archive for the many village photos, maps and
documents we collectively wish to retain.</p>

<p><b>The Village Hall</b>, with its larger capacity and ample car
parking, would be more focussed on larger gatherings, classes and
external bookings.</p>

<p>Historically, management groups have grappled
with the task of raising the finances required to maintain community
assets and to cover the day to day running costs. It is proposed that
to overcome this hurdle, parishioners will be invited to become
members of a village society and pay an annual subscription which will
cover entrance and use of both venues, (membership terms and
conditions of which are still to be agreed).  Subscriptions for
corporate and not for profit organisations will also be available,
plus additional income from external bookings.</p>

<p>We would really value your input, ideas and thoughts on how the
Chapel might be repurposed.  You can email us via
<a href="ChapelProject@souldern.org">ChapelProject@souldern.org</a></p>

<p>We are also going to have a FAQs page on the Souldern website by
the end of November.</p>

<h2>How to get involved</h2>


<p>Fundraising – To make this happen the village needs to raise
£75,000. Whilst the sum is daunting, the target allows for legal fees,
maintenance costs for the first three years and an allowance for
modest alterations.  Given the current COVID situation, match funding
organisations such as the Lottery Heritage fund are not open for new
applications. This situation may change in 2021. However, whilst we
are not under any pressing time constraints yet, the view is being
taken to do as much as possible without relying on the support of
external sources (unless somebody in the village can give us a
different view or steer).</p>

<p>If you feel willing and able to make a donation to help make this
project a success please contact one of the people listed below. They
will be happy to talk you through the various options available. *If
you are a UK tax payer, it is the intention to use the gift aid scheme
to gain additional revenue and if, at a later stage in the process,
additional grant funding is available, that will be a welcome bonus.</p>

<p>Ideas for use – To date, the steering group have discussed a number
of varied uses for the Chapel building, and for sure we do not have a
monopoly on good ideas!! So if you have a particular interest, hobby
or pastime that you feel able to share with the village that could
take place in either the village hall or Chapel please bring it to one
of the group. (They promise not to laugh!!!)  Input regarding ideas
for commercial or rental income from either building is also
welcome.</p>

<p>Organisation – If you are feeling particularly bold, why not stick
your hand up to get involved with either venue. Being a village run
organisation there will be many tasks that need to be addressed,
ranging from routine building maintenance through to MC’ing the finals
of the annual Pool tournament….and everything in between.</p>


<h3>A final thought on the Chapel’s next chapter in the village …..</h3>

<p>Throughout the lockdowns and 2020, the village has fostered a great
community spirit which everybody wants to continue once the country
emerges out the other side. We have all seen first hand what a special
place Souldern is and recognise how lucky we are to live here.</p>

<p>This is a one off opportunity to take ownership of a valuable
community asset and make it an enduring centrepiece for us and future
generations.  We owe it to Mr James Cox and to this village to make it
happen.</p>
