<h3 id="TOC-1869">1869</h3>
<p>In 1850 a group of non-conformists met in a small house in Chapel
Row, Souldern, Oxfordshire.</p>
<p>In 1869 a group of Wesleyan Reformers were given land in Back Lane by Mr.
James Cox who owned The Laurels (now Spring House). The original Trust Deed
stated that the Chapel should also be used as a Sabbath School
for teaching children. The Trustees were: James Fox, William Phillips, William
Hickman, John Heath, Thomas Hitchman, and Henry Hitchman. The foundation laying
was held on 6<sup>th</sup> July 1869. The Minutes of a meeting at Mr. Cox’s
house on 23<sup>rd</sup> July said, “Resolved that Mr. Cox have the
specification of the building of the new Chapel and proceed to the work
immediately.” The Chapel was built by local volunteers. Funds were small but
loans were obtained from Mrs. Butters of Banbury and from the Wesleyan Reform
Union, along with the sacrificial giving of the members.</p>

<p>A
Chapel Meeting on 7<sup>th</sup> March decided: “The Chapel Anniversary should
be held in the month of July.”</p>

<p>On the 23<sup>rd</sup> June it was decided to begin work on a new
Schoolroom. The estimate should not exceed £60.</p>
<p>The Schoolroom was opened in 1895 having cost
£64. In 1897 a meeting was held to decide how to pay
back the debt on the building project. It was decided to hold a Sale of Work
the first week in August. That same year a new dais was built in the Chapel and
a Service of Song was held to raise money for the work.</p>

<p>Over the past ten years we have had to give attention to the
maintenance of the fabric of the building.</p>
<p>In February <b>2000 </b>a new slate roof was put on the Chapel.
Donations from the village and past Sunday school children toward the cost was
organised by Major Gray together with additional grants totalling £5,063. Total
cost being £6157.</p>
<p>In May the Chapel was re-wired, costing £1,900, and in August the
Schoolroom was re-slated costing £2,500.</p>
<p>In October <b>2005 </b>the Chapel windows were renewed costing £4,406 with the
help of a generous grant from the Oxford Historic Churches Trust.</p>
<p>In <b>2006</b> the Schoolroom was decorated and re-furbished. New heating was
installed both in the Chapel and Schoolroom costing £3,174. This was possible
with the help of small grants and gifts.</p>
<p>In <b>2007 </b>the toilet block was re-furbished at a cost of £1,413.
along with the re-painting of the outside of the Chapel.</p>
<p>We appreciate the concern and help that we received from all
  sources.</p>
<h2 id="TOC-Mission-and-Ministry">Mission and Ministry</h2>
<p>The
Spiritual mission of the Chapel has always had pre-eminence. Preachers like J.
Whetton, Arthur Friday, R. Lake, and Robert Hitchman may have seemed “unlearned
and ignorant men” but they were always
ready to minister with an infectious dedication, enthusiasm and conviction –
even when a ten mile walk or bicycle ride was required to fulfill and
appointment.</p>
<p>A
weekly Class meeting helped the members to grow in their faith, a Christian
Endeavour met weekly; and a Band of Hope thrived inspired by Miss Hill an
Anglican. They
felt compelled to proclaim the good news of Christ to everyone in Souldern, so
a Mission was
held bi-annually. Missioners from the Evangelisation Society held tent missions
and Wesleyan Reform Evangelists– James Marsden, James Morris, Sister Gertrude,
Sister Gladys Cotterill all held meetings in the village.</p>
<p>In <b>1944</b> we had a visit from Mr. Stephen English and Mr. Niven of
the Caravan Mission to Village Children which became the Scripture Union. This
began a life-time association with Stephen who served the Chapel from time to
time until his death.</p>
<h3 id="TOC-Hosanna-Children-s-Home.">Hosanna Children’s Home.</h3>
<p>In
recent years we were introduced to Pastor Immanuel the Director of the
orphanage. He visited us several times and this encouraged us to support the
work in Tamil Nadu, South India. After
visiting the Sunday school children and their parents we began to support his
work by donating offerings and in 2007 the
parents of our children organised a Christmas sale, raising £1400 towards
repairing the roof of the main dormitory.</p>
<p>Sadly,
Pastor Immanuel died this past year but the work is being continued by his
brother Lemuel.</p>

<h2 id="TOC-The-Sunday-School">The Sunday School</h2>
<h3 id="TOC-18691">1869</h3>
<p>Sunday school was held in a small room built on the side of the
Chapel. We have no information of these early days.</p>
<h3 id="TOC-1895">1895</h3>
<p>A new schoolroom was built on the side of the Chapel. The minutes
suggested that no more than £60 be spent. It actually cost £64. Money was
raised by the Chapel members. The children sat on benches without back rests.
The Sunday school has been led by at least four Superintendants including:—
Mr. J. Fox. Sen., Mr. N. Jarvis, Mr. J. Fox and Mrs. A. Westbury. Audrey
Westbury has worked in Sunday school since 1942.</p>
<p>In <b>1905</b> there were 13 girls and 31 boys attending along with six
teachers.</p>
<p>In <b>1942 </b>there were 8 girls and 8 boys.</p>
<p>In <b>1970 </b>there were 16 girls and 12 boys.</p>
<p>In <b>1990 </b>there were 9 girls and 10 boys.</p>
<p>In <b>2009 </b>there are 4 girls and 6 boys.</p>
<p>Audrey is still the Sunday school leader assisted by the Mothers of the present children.</p>
<p>The Sunday school hold four special events in the course of a
year: Mothers’ Day, Sunday School Anniversary, Harvest Festival and Christmas
Carol Service.</p>
<h2 id="TOC-Fellowship-and-Outings">Fellowship and Outings</h2>
<p>In
the early days the Chapel became the centre of the members’ social, as well as
spiritual, lives. Sacred concerts,
later supplemented by Souldern Brass Band, led by Mr. H. Bates, and Services of
Song were a means of entertainment and raising money for the funds. These
events were often performed by visiting choirs from other Chapels as well as
the local members. Their hearty singing was said to draw the crowds. As well as
the two Sunday services the members joined together in the week for a Prayer
meeting, a Class meeting, a Christian Endeavour and a thriving Band of Hope,
inspired by Miss Hill, an Anglican and staunch Temperance supporter.</p>
<p>The
highlights of the Chapel’s year are the times when we have a visit from the
Denomination’s President and General Secretary, or guest preachers especially
at Harvest time. A recent feature has been the Easter meal and Harvest Supper.</p>
<h3 id="TOC-Outings">Outings</h3>
<p>Some of the members can remember going on organised outings when
they were children. On one occasion a special train had been chartered for the
Sunday schools of the area to begin at Banbury calling at the local stations.
Souldern people had to walk across the fields to Aynho station to be picked up.
Their final destination was Barry Island in Wales where they spent a happy day.</p>
<p>There were also trips arranged to Chessington Zoo, Regent’s Park
and Billing Aquadrome.</p>
<p>In <b>1952</b> it was decided to make Wicksteed
Park, in Kettering, the venue for the Sunday school
outing. It was so popular that Wicksteed has became the venue for all future
outings.</p>
<p>“We’ll praise Him for all that is past and trust Him for all
that’s to come.”</p>
