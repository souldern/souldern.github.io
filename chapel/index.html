<h2><a name="TOC-Chapel-News"></a>Chapel News</h2>
<div>I would like to invite you to our Sunday School and Chapel Anniversary on Sunday 17th June at 2.30.pm.<br /><br />The service will be followed by our usual refreshments.<br /><br />Our special guest speaker is the Rev. Maurice Nicholls. He  was  our  Group  Minister  in  the  seventies.  He  has served in many of our Churches and Chapels throughout the Country. He has also been our National President in past years.<br /><br />There has been a Chapel and Sunday school in the village for almost 150 years. With your support we would like to see our work for God continue.<br /><br />We  are  part  of  a  National  group  of  Churches  spread throughout the  Country. We  hold  to  the  teaching  of John  Wesley  and  are  locally  free  and  self-governing, hence the general name ‘Free Church’.<br /><br />So if you have shared with us in the past, or have not yet shared with us, why not accept this invitation? You will be warmly received.<br /><br /></div>
<p>Rev. John.</p>

In 1818 and 1819 dissenting meeting houses were licensed so a small Wesleyan
Chapel was built in Chapel Row in 1850, (now the end private house there — No 4)
<p>In 1869 a group of Wesleyan Reformers were given land by James Cox
who owned The Laurels (now Spring House). The original Trust Deed
stated that the Chapel should also be used as a Sabbath school for
teaching children and a small room was built on the side of the
Chapel. The Trustees included Mr Fox and the foundation stone was laid
on the 6th July 1869 in its present position in Back Lane.</p>
<p>In 1893 work began on a new school room and it was opened in 1895 and refurbished 
in 2006. It has been used ever since as a <a href="/chapel/sunday-school">Sunday School </a>with Mrs Audrey Westbury 
as Leader until her retirement due to ill health in March 2016.</p>
<p>In 1994 there were 125th Anniversary Celebrations. </p>
<p style="clear:all">Mr Robert Hitchman the author of three books recording his life and work in Souldern  
was one of the original members and a plaque was placed in the pulpit dedicated to 
his memory in 1994.</p>
<p>In 2009 John and Margret Goulder prepared a more detailed <a href="/chapel/history-of-souldern-chapel">history of the chapel</a> and Audrey Westbury recorded some <a href="/methodist-reform-chapel/memories-of-sunday-school" rel="nofollow">memories of her long association with the Sunday school</a> as part of the <a href="/chapel/sunday-school/140th-anniversary">140th Anniversary</a> celebrations.</p></div></div></div>
