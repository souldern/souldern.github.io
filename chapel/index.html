<h2><a name="TOC-Chapel-News"></a>Chapel News</h2>

<p>Before I was ordained as a minister I worked 
for the National Coal Board, occasionally going 
down local coal  mines.  On  my first visit first
timers were asked to turn off our helmet lights 
but not to move. It was here I experienced real 
darkness. It truly was a black as coal. I eventually got used to working with only a small helmet light to show the way. I am not sure that I 
like the dark winter days. Dark mornings and 
dark evenings.</p>

<p>Even though there are not many street lights in 
the villages it is never so dark that we lose our 
way. Even when the moon and stars are covered by the cloud there are pin points of light 
that light our path. Whatever difficult path we 
may have to travel, sickness, sorrow, bereavement, hurt, disappointment or the loss of personal peace, it is never so dark that you lose 
your way forever. There is a way and John the 
Baptist points to it. We find it in what the Bible 
has to say concerning the person of the Lord 
Jesus Christ.</p>

<p><b>St. John Ch. 1. Verse 4. 
“In Him (Jesus) was 
life, and that life was the light of men”. 
St. John Ch. 1. Verse 9. 
“The true light that 
gives  light  to  every  man  was  coming  into
the world”.</b></p>

<p>Please  remember  that  it  is  never  as  dark  as 
you  may  think.  God  is  willing  to  lead  you 
through the dark experiences of life as you put 
your trust in the Lord Jesus Christ.</p>

<p>Sadly, we are not so many at the Chapel at the 
moment but we are praying for God’  s revival 
blessing.  You  may  be  a  part  of  that  revival: 
therefore  we  invite  you  to  come  along  and 
share Worship with us.</p>

	    <p>Rev. John.</p>

In 1818 and 1819 dissenting meeting houses were licensed so a small Wesleyan
Chapel was built in Chapel Row in 1850, (now the end private house there — No 4)
<p>In 1869 a group of Wesleyan Reformers were given land by James Cox
who owned The Laurels (now Spring House). The original Trust Deed
stated that the Chapel should also be used as a Sabbath school for
teaching children and a small room was built on the side of the
Chapel. The Trustees included Mr Fox and the foundation stone was laid
on the 6th July 1869 in its present position in Back Lane.</p>
<p>In 1893 work began on a new school room and it was opened in 1895 and refurbished 
in 2006. It has been used ever since as a <a href="/chapel/sunday-school">Sunday School </a>with Mrs Audrey Westbury 
as Leader until her retirement due to ill health in March 2016.</p>
<p>In 1994 there were 125th Anniversary Celebrations. </p>
<p style="clear:all">Mr Robert Hitchman the author of three books recording his life and work in Souldern  
was one of the original members and a plaque was placed in the pulpit dedicated to 
his memory in 1994.</p>
<p>In 2009 John and Margret Goulder prepared a more detailed <a href="/chapel/history-of-souldern-chapel">history of the chapel</a> and Audrey Westbury recorded some <a href="/methodist-reform-chapel/memories-of-sunday-school" rel="nofollow">memories of her long association with the Sunday school</a> as part of the <a href="/chapel/sunday-school/140th-anniversary">140th Anniversary</a> celebrations.</p>
