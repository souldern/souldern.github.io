The testing of the 'pots' will take place from February 2016 through to the end of March 2016.<br/><br/>Once the 'pots' have been tested, the service will be useable and customers will be able to start booking their in-property installation.  <br/> <br/>We anticipate the Gigaclear broadband network to be fully built by the end of March 2016. <br/><br/>Please note that we cannot forecast the exact date when individual properties will be connected, but we will keep you informed as work progresses.<br/><br/>Whilst we aim to complete our work by these estimated dates, they may be subject to change due to external factors that are not under our control.<br/><br/>There are two types of in-property installations available<br/><br/><b>Gigaclear approved installers</b><br/><br/>With the in-property installation option, you will be contacted directly by our approved installation partner, Boxcom, who will agree and book an installation appointment with you.

<p align="center" style="text-align:center"><b>Update from Gigaclear Project Manager 15/01/16 </b></p>
<p>The Gigaclear contractors are currently working up to the
backhaul connection on the main road to Aynho. </p>
<p>This is where Gigaclear will pick up the feed for Souldern
and they anticipate connection by 29<sup>th</sup>January.</p>
<p> The contractors will then drop back into the village
to complete Network build works which will take about another week. On
completion one of the Gigaclear Civils supervisors will carry out a “walk
through” with the contractor to identify any snagging issues and assess if any
remedial works are necessary. Gigaclear have invited members of the Souldern Parish
Council to attend this walk around, and it is intended that at least two
councillors join them.</p>
<p> If you have an issue with any of the works that
Gigaclear have undertaken in the immediate vicinity of your property or
elsewhere in the village, please either contact Gigaclear directly before they
complete works or alternatively contact <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170610191053/mailto:nickoakhill@souldern.org">nickoakhill@souldern.org</a> or <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170610191053/mailto:parishclerk@souldern.org">parishclerk@souldern.org</a>, and they
will make sure that Gigaclear are made aware of the situation. It is very
likely that you will be contacted for further information regarding any
problem.</p>
<p>All works are expected to be completed by end of 1<sup>st</sup> week
in February and we will be furnished with an accurate “going live” date as soon
as it has been confirmed, which will be passed on to the village immediately.</p>
<p>The contact number for David Thrower, who is the Gigaclear
Project manager for Souldern, is 07789 543019. Not as shown in the latest
Parish newsletter 07789 54301, apologies for any confusion caused.</p>

<span style="color:rgb(255,140,0);font-size:14px"><b>What will Gigaclear do next?</b></span><br/>
<span style="color:rgb(0,0,0);font-size:14px">Our entire network is 
installed underground. The only items visible once we have completed the
 works will be the lids of the underground connection points installed 
at the boundary of every property. Gigaclear will install an underground
 fibre connection point outside every property we pass, not just those 
that sign up as customers. This is because we will only perform the 
digging work once, and we do not want to have to come back and dig again
 in the future. The fibres we install are designed to be in the ground 
for 50 years, and so provide a future proofed investment for the 
community. The connection point itself looks exactly the same as a water
 meter/stop-cock pot. There is no cost to have the connection point 
installed, so those that have not signed up for the service, will have 
one installed at the boundary of their property at no cost.<br/>
<br/>
Just before installation starts you will see a paint spot appear outside
 your property. This is the marker for the location of the Gigaclear 
connection point so that our contractors know where to install. If there
 is a problem with this location, please notify us by emailing us at: </span><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170610191053/mailto:info@gigaclear.com" style="font-size:14px;word-wrap:break-word;color:#ec6224;font-weight:normal;text-decoration:underline" target="_blank"><span style="color:#ff8c00">info@gigaclear.com</span></a><span style="color:rgb(0,0,0);font-size:14px"> or calling the office directly on: </span><span style="color:rgb(255,140,0);font-size:14px">01865 591131</span><span style="font-size:14px">.
 The location for the connection point (pot) is determined based on the 
route of the cables, and we are not always able to accommodate requests 
for changes to the location.</span><br/>
<br/>
<span style="color:rgb(255,140,0);font-size:14px"><b>How will the works progress?</b></span><br/>
<span style="color:rgb(0,0,0);font-size:14px">There will be a number of 
trenches dug along some pavements, verges and roads, together with a 
number of road crossings. The contractors perform this job for other 
utilities and are familiar with this type of work and how to avoid other
 services such as water and gas etc. Our network cables are not buried 
as deeply as the other services so there should be no reason that 
existing services are disturbed. There will be some cases where the 
trench has to be temporarily filled whilst waiting for other work to 
complete; in this case, you will see that the finish is not to normal 
standards. Once the other works are complete, the grounds will be 
reinstated to the Highways Agency standards.<br/>
<br/>
There are a number of stages to this project that involve some areas 
having to be worked on for longer than others. These will include 
several ‘pits’ that will need to be left open for several weeks as the 
fibres all meet in these pits, to then be connected together. Once the 
connections are complete, the pits are closed and we should not need to 
reopen them under normal circumstances. Whilst the pits are open, they 
will of course be protected with appropriate barriers for personal 
safety as well as equipment safety.</span><br/>
<br/>
<span style="color:rgb(255,140,0);font-size:14px"><b>When will you take any money from customers?</b></span><br/>
<span style="color:rgb(0,0,0);font-size:14px">Customers will not be 
charged anything until the service is installed and working in their 
property. At that point, we will collect the connection fee, any 
remainder of the current months service rental and the next months 
rental in advance. For customers who are 'self installing', we will need
 to collect your connection fee before your kit is shipped to you. You 
will be contacted beforehand to confirm this. Please note that for 'self
 install' customers your service subscription starts automatically <b>two weeks </b>after your kit has been delivered.  </span><br/>
<br/>
<span style="color:rgb(255,140,0);font-size:14px"><b>How do I make best use of the service?</b></span><br/>
<span style="color:rgb(0,0,0);font-size:14px">If you are a customer and have not done so already, please download your </span><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170610191053/http://gigaclear.us7.list-manage.com/track/click?u=8611d50f9da7ba0daea47acf4&amp;id=868fabc7e1&amp;e=841af4d834" style="font-size:14px;word-wrap:break-word;color:#ec6224;font-weight:normal;text-decoration:underline" target="_blank"><span style="color:#ff8c00">customer welcome pack</span></a><span style="color:rgb(0,0,0);font-size:14px">
 from here, as this will give you useful and important information about
 what to do and where best to have your router installed.</span><br/>
<br/>
<font color="#ff8c00"><span style="font-size:14px"><b>What about Telephony?</b></span></font><br/>
<span style="color:rgb(0,0,0);font-size:14px">For new customers who are 
not already using the Vonage telephone service, you can find information
 about their telephone services by visiting </span><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170610191053/http://gigaclear.us7.list-manage.com/track/click?u=8611d50f9da7ba0daea47acf4&amp;id=36824ca54f&amp;e=841af4d834" style="font-size:14px;word-wrap:break-word;color:#ec6224;font-weight:normal;text-decoration:underline" target="_blank"><span style="color:#ff8c00">www.vonage.co.uk/gigaclear</span></a><span style="color:rgb(255,140,0);font-size:14px"> </span><span style="color:rgb(0,0,0);font-size:14px">or call them free of charge on </span><span style="color:rgb(255,140,0);font-size:14px">0808 178 9620</span><span style="color:rgb(0,0,0);font-size:14px">. If you tell them you are a Gigaclear customer they will waive the connection fee saving you £10. Please <b>DO NOT</b>
 sign up to Vonage until your Gigaclear service has been installed. They
 are very efficient and once you have signed up your telephone adapter 
will generally arrive within 2 days and then you start paying your 
monthly subscription.   </span><br/>
