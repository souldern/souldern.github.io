# Playground Demolition: 13th March 2021

<div id="playgroundmarch21"></div>


## Souldern Playground Update

Saturday 13th March saw an impressive display of community
spirit. Villagers formed a formidable working party to remove the old
play equipment.

It was a moving moment, with fond memories shared of the joyful
recreation that Souldern Playground has given to many generations of
children.

New uses have been found for some of the remnants, and the work was an
exciting step towards regeneration of the playground and playing field
for decades to come.


Thank you to all those who helped. 

Best wishes,  
Lucy Mahhews
