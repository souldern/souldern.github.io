## Playground Plans 2023 &ndash;

![impression](playground-impression.png)

The project is now at the stage where fundraising must begin in earnest in order for the
village to be in a position to realise the plans. It is estimated that the total project will
cost approximately Â£150,000. Members of the playground advisory group, other
stakeholders and additional members of the village community have identified a number
of possible sources for grants. These need to be explored further with the help of
additional volunteers and local fundraising initiatives will also help add to the funds
which need to be raised.

If you are able to help in ways large or small, with either time
or expertise, please contact  
Alan or Heidi.

The playground was originally developed in 1973, it is sited on the edge of the playing field, behind the Village Hall. It was renovated and officially opened on 2nd May 1993 (picture on the left), and is maintained by a committee of volunteers under the supervision of the Parish council.
