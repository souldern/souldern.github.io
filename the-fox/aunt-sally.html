<p><b>Aunt Sally</b> is a traditional game, still played in many pubs in the Cotswolds and Oxfordshire area.</p>
<p>The dolly, a 10cm (4in) high ball or skittle,Â  is placed on a 
metal spike around a metre (40in) high. Players take it in turns to throw  6 sticks at the dolly.
The aim is to knock the dolly off the spike without hitting the spike.</p>
<p>The Fox Inn supports an Aunt Sally team that plays in the <a href="http://www.banburyasl.16mb.com/Division-4/division-4.html" rel="nofollow">Banbury &amp; District Aunt Sally League</a>.</p>
