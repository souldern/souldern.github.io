  <p><b>If you're strugglingâ€¦</b></p>

<p> We understand that life for more people than ever before may be
worrying and financially insecure, particularly during the Covid-19
pandemic. But if you are struggling with a specific expense or the
cost of basic food essentials then Souldern United Charity may be able
to help by providing some financial support or organising a food pack
from Wrightons for you. (Unfortunately we aren't able to assist with
  mortgage payments.)</p>

<p><b>Please contact any of the SUC trustees</b> in
confidence in the first instance (see below for names &amp; numbers),
  you're not alone.</p>
