<p>Built in 1974 the Village hall replaced the Parish Reading room which was destroyed by fire in 1971.</p>
<p>It was extended in 1977 by the erection of a store room and later in 1982 by another extension
providing changing room facilities for footballers. Later modernisations have taken place
with a new kitchen, solar panels for heating and provision of disabled amenities.
One boundary of the recreation field was enhanced by beech trees being planted by 
all Souldern children for the Silver Jubilee.</p>
<p>Refurbished in 2011, and more recently in 2015, the Village hall provides a warm, clean, light and versatile venue for a range of community events.</p>
<p>The village hall is fully accessible and offers off street parking. The main hall has an 80 person capacity, and there is a smaller room which can be used independently as a meeting or committee room, or in conjunction with the main hall.</p>
<p>The hall is managed by a committee representing all the village associations, which is elected annually.</p>
<p>The hall is by the playing field at the entrance to the village at the top of “The Hill”, <a href="https://www.google.co.uk/maps/place/51%C2%B058'40.1%22N+1%C2%B014'12.9%22W/@51.977817,-1.2381292,18z/data=!4m5!3m4!1s0x0:0x0!8m2!3d51.97782!4d-1.236905">as shown on the linked map</a>.</p>
