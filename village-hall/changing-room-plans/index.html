<p><span style="font-size:14.0pt;line-height:107%">The Souldern
Football Club folded early in 2017, and since then the Parish Council have been
reluctant to allow another club to use the football pitch/ changing rooms.
There does not appear to be any enthusiasm within the village to start up a new
team, and so consideration is being given to the future of the changing rooms.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.0pt;line-height:107%">They are
currently in poor condition, and whilst one option would be to do nothing with
them, it could be considered to be a waste of a valuable village asset.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.0pt;line-height:107%">Prior to the
construction of the village hall in 1974, the village used to have a reading
room. Unfortunately this was destroyed by fire in 1971. The idea put forward to
the parishioners is to make alterations to the changing rooms in order to
re-establish a reading room and village archive. Several members of the parish
continue to hold historical information/ minutes/ slides and photographs in
their attics/studies etc. It would be ideal to bring all of these together to
be held in one place, and whilst scanning and archiving electronically is
likely to be undertaken, many of the documents are fantastic to see in their
original format. It would be a shame to lose them to a Local council store room.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.0pt;line-height:107%">Three
alternative plans are laid out for the people of the village to comment on and
either come up with an alternative or let us know which option you prefer.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.0pt;line-height:107%">In the plans
you will note that the additional rooms are referred to as meeting rooms, these
are intended to be reading rooms primarily, but not exclusively. You will also
see that there is external access to a lavatory, which would be a welcome
additional facility for many that use the playground. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.0pt;line-height:107%">Once we have
received your thoughts, the Parish Council will make a decision on a course of
action to follow going forward. Whichever path is chosen, there will be a lot
to be done before we can enjoy the fruits of our labours.</span></p>
