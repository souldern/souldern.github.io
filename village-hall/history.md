Built in 1974 the Village hall replaced the Parish Reading room which
was destroyed by fire in 1971.

It was extended in 1977 by the erection of a store room and later in
1982 by another extension providing changing room facilities for
footballers. Later modernisations have taken place with a new kitchen,
solar panels for heating and provision of disabled amenities.  One
boundary of the recreation field was enhanced by beech trees being
planted by all Souldern children for the Silver Jubilee.

Refurbished in 2011, and 2015 and more recently in [2024](/home/gallery/vh2024),
the Village hall provides a warm, clean, light and versatile venue for a range of community events.
