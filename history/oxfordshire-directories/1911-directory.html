<p>SOULDERN is a parish and village, 1½ miles east by
footpath, or 3 miles by road from Aynho Park station
on the main line from London to Birmingham of the
Great Western Railway, 8 south-east from Banbury
and 7½ north-west from Bicester, in the Mid division
of the county, hundred and petty sessional division
of Ploughley, union and county court district of
Bicester, rural deanery of Bicester, archdeaconry
and diocese of Oxford. The river Cherwell bounds
the parish on the west, but is a mile and a half
from the village, which is pleasantly situated on
the south side of Aynho Park, on the borders of
Northamptonshire. The church of St. Mary is an ancient
building of stone in various styles, consisting of
chancel, clerestoried nave, north transept, south aisle,
south porch and a massive embattled tower of Early
Norman date, which was rebuilt in 1907, under the
directions of the late G. F. Bodley esq. R.A. and containing
6 bells and a sanctus bell: the nave is separated
from the south aisle by three pointed arches on round
columns, all Transitional, the capitals and bases of
which appear to have been reversed: the windows of
the aisle are elaborate specimens of Late Decorated
work: the porch is of the same date: the chancel
was rebuilt in 1896, on the site of a former chancel
of the 14th century, from designs by Messrs. Bucknall
and Comper, architects, and a stained east window was
placed at the same time: in the chancel is a brass to
John Throckmorton, ob. 1537, which has been restored
by Sir William Throckmorton bart.; and there are two
other brasses, one to Thomas Warner, parson, ob. 1508
(or 1514); and another representing a heart with scrolls:
the nave retains some old carved benches: the very ancient
font is presumably Saxon: the church was restored in
1878–9, the work being begun on 4 Dec. in the former year,
and in the course of it the western gallery was taken down:
there are now 200 sittings. The churchyard has been enlarged.
The register dates from the year 1668. The
living is a rectory, net yearly value £350, with residence
and 130 acres of glebe, in the gift of St. John's College,
Cambridge, and held since 1901 by the Rev. Eric John
Sutherland Rudd M.A. formerly fellow of that college, and
prebendary of Hereford Cathedral. A new rectory house
was built in 1890–1. The Catholic church, dedicated
to St. Joseph, and built in lieu of one formerly attached
to the Manor house, was erected and endowed
by the Cox, Dolman and Stapleton families in the
beginning of the last century. There is also a Wesleyan
chapel, erected in 1869. The parochial charities produce
about £30 yearly for distribution in bread and
clothing; there are also cottages and gardens and allotment
gardens on the old green, which are let to the poor
at a nominal rent.</p>

<p>In and adjoining the parish are stone
quarries. Wordsworth, the poet, was a constant visitor
here during the incumbency of his college friend, the
Rev. Robert Jones, rector of Souldern 1806, and here he
composed a sonnet on Souldern rectory, entitled,
“ On a Parsonage in Oxfordshire.”
Ploughley Hill, a curious
bell-shaped Saxon barrow, was almost entirely levelled at
the commencement of the 19th century for highway purposes.
Some Saxon remains, consisting of urns, brass
straps and bone ornaments, have been dug up in the
neighbourhood, and are in the possession of Sir A. E.
Dryden bart. of Canons Ashby, Northants. William de la
Pole, Duke of Suffolk K.G. executed in 1449 in Dover
roads, on board the “Nicholas of the Tower,” held with
Alice (Chancer), his wife, a portion of the lands. The
landowners are Lt.-Col. England, Magdalen College, Oxford,
William Cornwallis Cartwright esq. of Aynho, G.
Wood esq. the trustees of the late Major Edgworth
Horrocks, Charles Henry Beeston Prescott-Westcarr, of
Strode Park, Herne, Kent, Mrs. Hill and Mrs. Gough.
The soil is fertile, clay and loam near the Cherwell,
sand and stone brash on the high ground; the subsoil
varies at different points of the parish, and consists of
limestone, iron stone, clay, sand and gravel, divided
into arable and pasture. The area is 1,485 acres of
land and 11 of water; rateable value, £4,792; the population
in 1901 was 406.
