<h3><a name="TOC-SOULDERN-PARISH."></a>SOULDERN PARISH.</h3>
<p>The area of Souldern parish is 2,270 acres; its population in 1831 was
599 ; and in 1841, 604 souls. The rateable value is £3,023.; and the
amount of assessed property £2,877. The principal landowners are R. S.
Cox, Esq.; the trustees under the will of the late Richard Gough, Esq.; and
Henry Westcow, Esq. The Cherwell flows through the parish, and there are
quarries of plank stone in this and the adjoining parish.</p>
<p><i>The Village of Souldern</i> is pleasantly situated on the south side of
Aynho park, about 3½ miles E. by S. from Deddington.</p>
<p><i>The Church</i>, dedicated to St. Mary, is a curious old structure, and consists
of nave, south aisle, chancel, and west tower containing four bells. In the
chancel is a slab to the memory of the Rev. Jeffrey Shaw, who died suddenly
whilst reading the second lesson of the service, on the 17th of November,
1776; it is said, he was previously forewarned by a deceased college
friend, that his end was near. The tower is early Norman, having walls of
considerable thickness, but inclines from the perpendicular. The living is a
rectory, valued in the king's books at £8. 14s. 2d.; gross income, £480. It
is in the patronage of St. John's college, Cambridge; and incumbency of the
Rev. Lawrence Stephenson, D.D., late fellow of that college, and lecturer on
algebra. The tithes were commuted in 1839 for a rent charge of £418. 3s.,
and there are 122 acres of land in Fritwell, also in lieu of tithes belonging to
this living.</p>
<p><i>The Rectory</i> House at the side of the church, is a very interesting specimen
of the parsonage houses of the English clergy of days gone by.</p>
<p><i>The School</i> is endowed with £7. per annum out of Mrs. Westcar's charity.
The school house, a neat building, was erected in 1816, at the expense of
William and James Mynn, Esquires. In addition, Mr. James Mynn has
recently given a piece of land and two cottages adjoining the school, for
residences for the teachers.</p>
<p><i>Charities</i>. The poor's allotment yields an annual rental of about £5.
Thomas Dodwell gave in 1794, a yearly rent charge of 30s. for clothing two
poor persons. He also left four 3d. loaves per week, to be given to four
widows. The sum of £2. 3s. 4d. is received every year for the poor, from
the proprietor of the Aynho estate. This is part of a rent charge mentioned
in the marriage settlement of W. R. Cartwright, Esq., dated 8th of April,
1784. Elizabeth Westcar, of Hill house, in this parish, by will dated June,
1820, left to the poor certain legacies, which were laid out in the purchase
of stock, since converted into £544. 8s. 6d., four per cents.</p>
