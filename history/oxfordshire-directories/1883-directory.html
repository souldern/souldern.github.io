<p><b>SOULDERN</b> is a parish in the hundred of Ploughley, union and
county court district of Bicester, rural deanery of Bicester,
archdeaconry and diocese of Oxford, 7 miles north-west from Bicester,
7 miles south-east from Banbury and one mile and a half from Aynho
station on the Great Western raihvay. The river Cherwell bounds the
parish on the west, but is a mile and a half from the village, which
is pleasantly situated on the south side of Aynho Park, on the borders
of Northamptonshire. The church of St. Mary is an ancient stone
structure of various styles, consisting of chancel, clerestoried nave,
south aisle, porch and a tower of Early Norman date, having walls of
considerable thickness, and containing 4 bells and a sanctus bell: the
nave is separated from the south aisle by three pointed arches resting
on round columns, the capitals and bases of which are Norman and
appear to have been reversed: the windows of the aisle are elaborate
specimens of Late Decorated work: the porch is of the same date: the
chancel is modern: since the 4th December, 1878, this interesting old
church has undergone substantial restoration: the western gallery
which entirely concealed a massive Roman arch, and a very marked
feature of the original church, has been removed: the pillars and
arches of the arcade have been scraped and cleaned: stained windows
have been inserted in the chancel and in the west window. Sir William
Throckmorton bart. has also restored a brass in the chancel to John
Throckmorton, one of his ancestors, 1537; there are two other brasses,
one to Thomas Warner, parson, 1508 (or 1514); and a third of a heart
with scrolls: in the nave are some old carved benches: a small
addition has been made to the churchyard. The register dates from the
year 1668. The living is a rectory, gross yearly value £600 with
residence and 125 acres of glebe, in the gift of St. John's College,
Cambridge, and held since 1835 by the Rev. Lawrence Stephenson
D.D. formerly fellow of that college. The rectory house, situated
north of the church, is a picturesque Elizabethan building, surrounded
by fine lime trees. The Catholic chapel of St. Joseph, built in lieu
of one formerly attached to the Manor house, was erected and endowed
by the Cox, Dolman and Stapleton families late in the seventeenth
century.</p></div>
<div>
<p>
There is also a chapel for Wesleyans. The parochial charities
produce an annual amount of about £43 for distribution in bread and
clothing. There are stone quarries in and adjoining the
parish. Wordsworth, the poet, was a constant visitor here during the
incumbency of his college friend the late Rev. Robert Jones and here
he composed a sonnet on Souldern rectory, entitled “On a Parsonage in
Oxfordshire.” Some Saxon remains, consisting of urns, brass straps and
bone ornaments, have been dug up in the neighbourhood and are in the
possession of Sir H. E. Leigh Dryden bart. William Duke of Suffolk,
killed in 1449, held with Alice his wife a portion of the lands. The
landowners are R. S. Cox esq. of Broxwood Court, Herefordshire,
W. C. Cartwright esq. M.P. of Aynho, John Rowland Crook, J. Hill
Gough, barrister-at-law, and John Hill esqs. The soil is fertile, clay
and loam near the Cherwell, sand and stone brash on the high ground;
the subsoil varies at different points of the parish, and consists of
limestone, iron stone, clay, sand and gravel, divided into arable and
pasture. The area is 1,451 acres; rateable value, £3,433; the
population in 1881 was 515.</p>
