<p><b>SOULDERN</b> is a parish and village, 1½ miles east by
footpath, or 2½ miles by road from Aynho station on the
Oxford and Birmingham line of the Great Western railway,
8 south-east from Banbury and 7½ north-west from
Bicester, in the Mid division of the county, hundred and
petty sessional division of Ploughley, union and county
court district of Bicester, rural deanery of Bicester,
arch-deaconry and diocese of Oxford. The river Cherwell
bounds the parish on the west, but is a mile and a half
from the village, which is pleasantly situated on the south
side of Aynho Park, on the borders of Northamptonshire.
The church of St. Mary is an ancient building of stone
in various styles, consisting of chancel, clerestoried nave,
south aisle, south porch and a massive embattled tower
of Early Norman date, containing 4 bells and a sanctus
bell: the nave is separated from the south aisle by three
pointed arches on round columns, the capitals and bases
of which are Norman and appear to have been reversed:
the windows of the aisle are elaborate specimens of Late
Decorated work: the porch is of the same date: the
chancel is modern: the east and west windows and others
in the church are filled with stained glass: in the chancel
is a brass to John Throckmorton, ob. 1537, which has
been restored by Sir William Throckmorton bart.; and
there are two other brasses, one to Thomas Warner,
parson, ob. 1508 (or 1514); and another representing a
heart with scrolls: the nave retains some old carved
benches: the church was restored in 1878–9 the work
being begun on 4 Dec. in the former year, and in the
course of it the western gallery was taken down: there
are now 200 sittings. The churchyard has been
enlarged. The register dates from the year 1668.
The living is a rectory, tithe rent-charge £431,
average £320, net yearly value £471, with residence and
130 acres of glebe, in the gift of St. John's College, Cambridge,
and held since 1890 by the Rev. John Wilberforce
Doran M.A. formerly scholar of that college. A new rectory
house was built in 1890–1. The Catholic chapel,
dedicated to St. Joseph, built in lieu of one formerly 
attached to the Manor house, was erected and endowed
by the Cox, Dolman and Stapleton families in the beginning
of the present century. There is also a Wesleyan
chapel. The parochial charities produce about £43
yearly for distribution in bread and clothing.

<p>In and adjoining the parish are stone quarries. Wordsworth the
 poet was a constant visitor here during the incumbency
 of his college friend the late Rev. Robert Jones, rector of
 Souldern 1806, and here he composed a sonnet on Souldern rectory, entitled “On a Parsonage in Oxfordshire.”
Ploughley Hill is a curious Saxon barrow, turned like a
bell, small and high, almost entirely levelled at the
commencement of the century for highway purposes. Some
Saxon remains, consisting of urns, brass straps and bone
ornaments, have been dug up in the neighbourhood and
 are in the possession of Sir H. E. Leigh Dryden bart. of
 Canons Ashby, Northants. William de la Pole, Duke of
