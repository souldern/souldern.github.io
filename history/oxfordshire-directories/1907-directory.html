<p><b>SOULDERN</b> is a parish and village, 1½ miles east by
footpath, or 2½ miles by road from Aynho station on the
Oxford and Birmingham line of the Great Western railway,
8 south-east from Banbury and 7½ north-west from
Bicester, in the Mid division of the county. hundred and
petty sessional division of Ploughley, union and county
court district of Bicester, rural deanery of Bicester, arch­deaconry
and diocese of Oxford. The new line of the
Great Western railway from Aynho through Bicester to
Horesendon will pass through this parish. The river
Cherwell bounds the parish on the west, but is a mile
and a half from the village, which is pleasantly situated
on the south side of Aynho Park, on the borders of
Northamptonshire. The church of St. Mary is an ancient
building of stone in various styles, consisting of
chancel, clerestoried nave, north transept, south aisle,
south porch and a massive embattled tower of Early
Norman date, now (1907) being rebuilt under the
directions of G. F. Bodley esq. R.A. and containing
6 bells and a sanctus bell : the nave is separated from
the south aisle by three pointed arches on round
columns, all Transitional, the capitals and bases of
which appear to have been reversed: the windows of
the aisle are elaborate specimens of Late Decorated
work: the porch is of the same date: the chancel
was rebuilt in 1896, on the site of a former chancel
of the 14th century, from designs by Messrs. Bucknall
and Comper, architects, and a stained east window was
placed at the same time: in the chancel is a brass to
John Throckmorton, ob. 1537, which has been restored
by Sir William Throckmorton bart.; and there are two
other brasses, one to Thomas Warner, parson, ob. 1508
(or 1514); and another representing a heart with scrolls:
the nave retains some old carved benches: the very ancient
font is presumably Saxon: the church was restored in 
1878–9, the work being begun on 4 Dec. in the former year,
and in the course of it the western gallery was taken down:
there are now 200 sittings. The churchyard has been enlarged.
The register dates from the year 1668. The 
living is a rectory, net yearly value £340, with, residence
and 130 acres of glebe, in the gift of St. John's College,
Cambridge, and held since 1901 by the Rev. Eric John
Sutherland Rudd M.A. formerly fellow of that college, and
prebendary of Hereford Cathedral. A new rectory house
was built in 1890–1. The Catholic church, dedicated
to St. Joseph, and built in lieu of one formerly
attached to the Manor house, was erected and endowed
 by the Cox, Dolman and Stapleton families in the 
 beginning of the present century. There is also a Wesleyan
 chapel, erected in 1869. The parochial charities
 produce about £30 yearly for distribution in bread and 
 clothing; there are also cottages and gardens and allotment
 gardens on the old green, which are let to the poor 
 at a nominal rent.

<p>In and adjoining the parish are stone
quarries. Wordsworth, the poet, was a constant visitor
 here during the incumbency of his college friend, the late
 Rev. Robert Jones, rector of Souldern 1806, and here he
 composed a sonnet on Souldern rectory, entitled,
 “On a Parsonage in Oxfordshire.”
 Ploughley Hill, a curious
 bell-shaped Saxon barrow, was almost entirely levelled at
 the commencement of the 19th century for highway
 purposes. Some Saxon remains, consisting of urns, brass
 straps and bone ornaments, have been dug up in the
 neighbourhood, and are in the possession of Sir A. E.
 Dryden bart. of Canons Ashby, Northants. William de la
 Pole, Duke of Suffolk K.G. executed in 1449 in Dover
 roads, on board the “Nicholas of the Tower,” held with
 Alice (Chancer), his wife, a portion of the lands. Souldern
 Manor House is the residence of Lieut.-Col. Albert Edward
 England R.A., J.P. The landowners are Lt.-Col. England,
 Magdalen College, Oxford, William Cornwallis
 Cartwright esq. of Aynho, G. Wood esq. Major Edgworth
 Horrocks, of Paddock Wood, Kent, Capt. Charles
 William Prescott-Westcarr, of Strode Park, Herne, Kent,
 Mrs. Hill and Mrs. Gough. The soil is fertile, clay and
 loam near the Cherwell, sand and stone brash on the high
 ground; the subsoil varies at different points of the parish,
 and consists of limestone, iron stone, clay, sand and gravel,
divided into arable and pasture. The area is 1,485 acres
 of land and 11 of water; rateable value, £4,620; the
 population in 1901 was 406.
