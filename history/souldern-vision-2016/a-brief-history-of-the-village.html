<p>The population of Souldern was 575 in 1881 and 371 in 1951. The
2011 census recorded the population as 370.</p>
<p>During the War years, 15 men did not return from the 1914–1918 war
and of the 46 men who served in the 1939–45 war, 2 did not
return. Those that did received a sum of £3 from the Souldern Welcome
Home scheme.</p>
<p>The Villagers lived mainly in cottages on The Hill, Bates Lane, Fox
Lane, Chapel Row and the cottages that were once on The Green – on
land now owned by Souldern Manor. These cottages were replaced in the
1950’s by the Bovewell Estate near to the recreation ground. There
were a few cottages belonging to larger houses such as The Hollies,
The Court, The Hermitage, Manor Farm, Souldern Manor and Souldern
Lodge (now Souldern House) The Rectory, the Wall House, Fox Hill
Farmhouse and Greystones.</p>
<p>Most of the men in the Village worked on the farms but some were
self employed – a saddler and harness maker, two cobblers, many hedge
cutters, carters, shepherds and milkmen. Almost every boy leaving
school began work on the farms or in the gardens, especially during
the war years. Joe Bates and Will Lett would go to Banbury on market
days to get articles for other villagers. Joe was a village coal
merchant, haulier, small holder and pig killer at West End. Will lived
at Timber Cottage, and supplied the fly for village weddings. His
brother Richard was head gardener at the Manor.</p>
<p>Henry Binding had a forge at The Crown, but in 1912 moved to Sunny
Bank and its nearby paddock. The property The Old Forge was once
owned by John and William Plumb who ran a forge there and horses
waited outside to be shod. Nathan Jarvis was a wheelwright, carpenter
and joiner. He had premises at The Orchard. He was also the
undertaker. There was also another carpenter, Edward Arnold, who lived
near the Pond. Lace was made by the Souldern ladies and sold in
Banbury.</p>
<p>In the early part of the 20th century there were three public
houses; The Crown, The Bull’s Head and The Fox. The Bear was in
Fritwell and was transferred to Souldern with other land in 1953, but
was also used by Souldern villagers.</p>
<p>There were three shops, The Hollies, owned by the Boddington family
who were bakers and butchers. They cooked villagers’ bread and pudding
in their bread oven, which is in Back Lane, and also sold
provisions. Built in 1700 and owned by the Gough family, the Village
Stores and Post Office was at Deepwell Cottage. This was first rented
to Kings of Syresham and then in 1920 to the Kyte family. In 1949 Doug
Lee and his family owned this shop and Post Office. Another early shop
was run by Albert Titcombe on the premises which were previously the
Bull’s Head public house and is now a garage. Albert was a baker and
smallholder who sold bread, cakes, faggots, pies and sausages. For
shopping in Banbury, a villager would walk to Aynho station and board
a train, returning the same way. In 1929 Jack and Mary Callow opened
a shop at Callows Cottage in Bates Lane, they also sold items from a
pony and trap. In 1972 they built Callows Stores in the High
Street.</p>
<p>This was demolished in 1991 and 4 cottages built there.</p>
<p>The Pound, (now called the Secret Garden) and the Allotments are
owned by Souldern United Charity. The allotments are rented out for a
small fee. The Green and the recreation field, together with Nancy
Bowles Wood, are all owned by the Parish Council. The Green is an
ancient open space with a seat commemorating the Jubilee of King
George VI. The recreation field was sold to the Parish Council in 1970
by Ploughley District Council. Nancy Bowles Wood was set up in 1986
after the purchase of the land by the Parish Council from Nancy who
lived at Rose Cottage in Bates Lane.</p>
<p>The Church of England school had 47 pupils in 1937 and closed in
1964. Pupils then went to Fritwell. It is now a private house. The
Catholic school (now Appleton Lodge), hosted the Coronation lunch for
the village in 1953. It closed as a school in 1904. The Wesleyan Reform
Chapel in Back Lane still has a Sunday School for children.</p>
<p>The earliest record of a burial at The Church of the Annunciation
to the Blessed Virgin Mary (St Mary’s) is dated 1161. The font is 12th
century and there were restorations to the building in the 13th and
15th centuries. The original Rectory was at the rear of the Church but
was demolished because of deterioration and a new Rectory was built on
higher ground with access from the main B4100 road. St Joseph’s
Catholic Church was built in Souldern Manor grounds and is now an
office. The priest lived in the Catholic Presbytery, now St
Joseph’s. The Wesleyan Reform Chapel was built in 1869. Prior to this
services were held in a small cottage in Chapel Row.</p>
<p>A Working Men’s Club was formed in 1816 initially with 84
members. Every 29th May everyone wore oak leaves and there was a
parade ending with a Church service and a fair on The Green. The club
ended in the 1930’s. The Souldern Football Club won the Lord Jersey
Cup in 1924–25 and again in 1978–79 and is still running. A
Horticultural Society was formed in 1905 with Aynho and was restarted
in Souldern in 1981. Souldern no longer has a Mother’s Union or WI,
the latter being disbanded in the 1990’s</p>
<p>Two Doctors came to Souldern from Deddington, three days a week to
the surgery at Mrs Sweetman’s near to the school. The village also had
two resident midwives, Mrs Rouse and Mrs Plumb. Later there was a
surgery next to the Parish Reading Room which was in Church
Lane. Deddington Health Centre is now the main surgery for
Souldern. The Parish Reading Room was destroyed by fire in 1971 and
plans were started to build a village hall on part of the recreation
field. This finalised in 1974.</p>
<p>There was an 1888 church magazine published and a South Oxon
Electoral Magazine in 1927 followed by the “Ploughley 20” which was
followed by the Three Parishes in 1978, which still remains.</p>

Robert Hitchman’s books to be used for the benefit of Souldern
village.</i></p>
