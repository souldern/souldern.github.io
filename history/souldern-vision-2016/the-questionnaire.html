<p>‘A Vision for Souldern’ was launched on the 20th June
2015. Residents were asked to give their many opinions and ideas on
village life here in Souldern using post-it notes. The contents of
these post-it notes were then used to help to compile a resident’s
questionnaire to gauge the depth of feeling across a broad range of
topics within our community. The questionnaires were then circulated
to every household in the Parish of Souldern.</p>
<p>66% of households responded to the survey. This represents 268
residents from 118 households. These figures should be borne in mind
when reading the following analysis, however there is no reason to
suppose they do not reflect a cross section of opinions in the
village.</p>
<p>We would like to thank everyone who contributed by completing the
questionnaire.</p>
