<p>As is very apparent from reading the comments and suggestions in
this questionnaire, Souldern is a beautiful village nestled in the
heart of Oxfordshire and we are very lucky to live here.</p>
<p>What is also apparent is that during the time that it has taken to
collect and collate the information in this booklet Souldern has not
been standing still and many important issues have already been
addressed and realised such as faster broadband, the village website,
dog bins, regular community events, church and chapel working together
to provide for the needs of children, young people and families
etc.</p>
<p>The Parish Council work tirelessly on behalf of the community
making decisions and keeping residents informed. This survey will help
in the future, when important issues which may affect everyone, are
being addressed.</p>
<p>So thank you particularly to everyone who cares enough to have
taken the time and the trouble to voice your opinions, ideas and
concerns. Without you this picture for the way forward would not have
been painted.</p>
<p>At the back of this booklet is some useful information and the
contact details of people to approach should you wish to be involved,
organise or contribute in any way to continuing all the good work and
activities that are already taking place.</p>
