butchers supplying home killed mutton and pork. They were also bakers of

took priority over the bread. The bread oven is in Back Lane.</p>

<h3 id="TOC-SOULDERN-MANOR-HOUSE">SOULDERN MANOR HOUSE</h3>
<p>Mentioned on old maps as Souldern 
House, the manor was built in the second half of the 17th century by Bernard 
Weedon who died in 1679. He had the original medieval manor house in 
Great House Close pulled down and erected this new dwelling with 
substantial walls of grey stone on a site overlooking the Cherwell Valley.</p>
<p>The Weedons were Roman Catholic, and a date of 1665 appears on 
stonework on one of the rooms known as “Old Vestry”. This room was 
probably used as a Roman Catholic Chapel. In 1781 the Roman Catholic 
Chapel in the attic of the house was closed and the sacred vessels and 
vestments moved to London. A priest's hiding place was discovered in the 
house in 1877 and a Roman Catholic School was recorded as built nearby 
in 1879.</p>
<p>Colonel and Mrs. England were the first Protestants to occupy the 
house in the 1890’s and during their stay gave joints of beef every 
Christmas to the working class families in the village.</p>

SOULDERN MILL</h3>
<p>This was an early 14th century building where the village corn was ground for use. The last Miller was Albert White who carried on the business until the early 1930s. The mill had a large overshot wheel of sufficient power to drive four pairs of stones. It is unusual to have as many as this in a village mill.</p>
