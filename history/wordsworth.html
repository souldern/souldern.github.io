<blockquote>
Where holy ground begins, unhallowed ends,<br />
Is marked by no distinguishable line;<br />
The turf unites, the pathways intertwine;<br />
And, wheresoe'er the stealing footstep tends,<br />
Garden, and that domain where kindred, friends,<br />
And neighbours rest together, here confound<br />
Their several features, mingled like the sound<br />
Of many waters, or as evening blends<br />
With shady night. Soft airs, from shrub and flower,<br />
Waft fragrant greetings to each silent grave;<br />
And while those lofty poplars gently wave<br />
Their tops, between them comes and goes a sky<br />
Bright as the glimpses of eternity,<br />
To saints accorded in their mortal hour.
</blockquote>
