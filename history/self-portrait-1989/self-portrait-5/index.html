<p style="text-indent:0em">A portrait such as this, if it is to be an honest description of
villagers' concerns and anxieties, inevitably runs the risk of
appearing to be too critical, painting too dark a picture of life in
the village as it is perceived by those who live here today. Although
it is a small community by present-day standards, it is evident that
Souldern has much to commend it for those who live here. For its size,
it is well served by Church and Chapel, pubs and village hall, shops
and garage and by those who run such assets and groups as the monthly
news sheet, the Women's Institute, the Playing Field, the weekly Bingo
Sessions and trips for the elderly, the Football Club, the Nancy
Bowles Wood and so on. A fine example of such enterprise and
cooperation is the Horticultural Society. With a membership of almost
80, it organises lectures and demonstrations, a popular produce show,
a well supported regular cheese and wine party, and above all, an
annual Open Gardens Scheme which brings hundreds of
appreciative visitors to Souldern, enhances the funds of local
organisations and engenders a sense of co-operation and communal pride
amongst the village residents. This sense of pride in the appearance
of the village is reflected in its attainments in the county-wide Best
Kept Village competition, Souldern having achieved success in 1980,
1981, 1986, 1987 and 1990.</p>

<p>Perhaps it is appropriate to leave the last
words to some newcomers who have come from far away to live
temporarily in the village.</p>
<p>“I'm new to England and Souldern and will
probably be here for a few years, but I'll share a few of my
impressions. Souldern is one of the most beautiful villages we
encountered while searching for a place to live. We received a warm,
friendly welcome when we moved in. We not only like the wonderful
people but also appreciate the quiet beauty and the fact that there is
no through traffic. Our only regret, so far, is that we have not been
involved with village activities and haven't contributed in
anyway. Hopefully, as our schedules allow, we will be able to get
involved and possibly contribute in some small way”.</p>
