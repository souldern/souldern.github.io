In designing and distributing the questionnaire, analysing the
responses and producing this booklet, members of the committee have
been encouraged and aided by a number of organisations and individuals.
</p>
<p>
We should never have been able to achieve this study without generous
financial help from Souldern Parish Council, the Village Horticultural
Society, the Oxfordshire Rural Community Council and from individual
villagers.  We are indebted for advice and guidance to Mr Roger
Davies, Field Officer of the ORCC, and to Mrs Jean Fletcher for the
excellently produced maps of the village and of the footpaths in the
parish. We are grateful to Mrs Kathleen McDouall, editor and publisher
of the monthly â€œThe Three Parishes", for the help she has given.
</p>
<p>But
above all, we are grateful to the villagers of Souldern whose
production this really is. Without their generous response to the
questionnaire, their helpfulness and good humour, this village self
portrait would never have been produced.</p>
