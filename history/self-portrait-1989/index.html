SELF PORTRAIT OF A VILLAGE</h2>
<p>In 1989 The Parish council initiated a survey of the village residents.</p>
<p>The purpose of the Appraisal was to gather information on a 
variety of topics relevant to Souldern, which could be used as a guide 
when considering what changes should be supported or opposed.</p>
<p>The booklet drawn up analysing the results of the survey is presented in these pages.</p>
