<p style="text-indent:0em">This Appraisal Report is based upon the responses to a
questionnaire which was delivered to every household in the village on
Saturday, the 17th June 1989, and was completed in the following
week. It consisted of two parts. The first, which sought statistical
information about each family (number of adults and children in each
house) and house (ownership, services, heating, garaging, vehicles
etc), was completed by one adult for each household. The second, which
invited information about all the residents, was completed by each
individual over the age of 11 years.</p>

<p>The lengthier part requested, firstly, statistical information
about individuals, length of stay in the village, age, disabilities,
leisure interests, employment, use of services and facilities in the
village; and, secondly, sought 
people's views on housing
developments and certain specific issues which it was known were of
interest or concern. Finally, respondents were asked to comment upon
what they valued in the village, what they would wish to see changed
and what preserved, and were invited to expand upon any matters of
concern to them. There was a most impressive response from people in
the village to the questionnaire, approximately 80% taking the time
and trouble to reply. In studying the information and reading the
comments which are set out in this appraisal booklet, readers must
bear in mind that, while no doubt the contents are representative,
they are not based upon all the households and inhabitants of the
village.</p>
<p>However, there is every reason to believe that the four fifths of
the residents who did reply (a total of 213) form a cross section of
opinion in the whole village.</p>
