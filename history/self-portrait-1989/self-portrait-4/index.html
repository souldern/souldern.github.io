<h3 style="text-indent:0em"><a name="TOC-HOUSEHOLDS"></a>HOUSEHOLDS</h3>
<p style="text-indent:0em">Replies were received from 108 households, approximately three
quarters (76.6%) of whom were living in freehold properties and just
under a quarter (23.4%) in rented accommodation.</p>
<div style="text-indent:0em;display:inline;margin:5px 10px 0px 0px;float:left"><a href="/history/self-portrait-1989/self-portrait-0/p005a.png" imageanchor="1"><img border="0" height="139" src="/history/self-portrait-1989/self-portrait-0/p005a.png" width="200" /></a></div>
<p>The average number of people including children living in each
household was 2.74. Clearly the question of overcrowding is not the
problem it was 100 years ago. The “Bicester Advertiser” for
the 15th November 1889 reported a widow, Mary Lake, being summoned for
occupying a house too small for its inmates, four children, a mother
and grandmother, and being ordered to reduce the number by two within the
space of a week!</p>

<p style="clear:left">Replies about services to houses indicated that all were served by
electricity, 94% had mains water, almost 92% had a telephone and 85%
were connected to the mains sewerage. The following diagram indicates
the proportions using different sources of heating. It totals over
100% because some households use more than one source.</p>

<p>53% of the householders confirmed that if ever gas were made
available in the village they would seriously consider having it
connected to their homes.</p>
<div style="text-indent:0em;display:inline;margin:5px 10px 0px 0px;float:left"><a href="/history/self-portrait-1989/self-portrait-0/p006a.png" imageanchor="1"><img border="0" height="172" src="/history/self-portrait-1989/self-portrait-0/p006a.png" width="320" /></a></div>
<p>60.7% of those replying confirmed that they possessed a garage but
the  questionnaire did not elicit the information as to whether these
garages were used for sheltering cars or for other storage purposes.</p>
<p>Concerning vehicles, residents claimed the ownership of 141 private
cars, 2 motorcycles and 86 bicycles (one at least with flat
tyres). 53% of the cars are normally left in the village during the
day and there were 156 car drivers.</p>

<p style="text-indent:0em">It should be remembered that the information in this section is
based upon the questionnaires actually returned and so does not
constitute a complete census. Nevertheless, replies were received from
98 men and 115 women, representing about 80% of the total village
population.</p>

<p>As might be expected, most of the people in the parish are of a
mature age with almost 66.6% over 39 years and almost 35% over 60
years old. There are just 19 children in Souldern aged 11–17 and less
than 40 people under 30 years of age.</p>

<p>Bearing in mind the age profile for the village, we are
nevertheless a fit community. Just 6 persons are officially registered
as disabled and 3 are blind or partially sighted.</p>
<p>One in three families (54) in Souldern today has its roots deep in
the past.  Indeed, one family was establishing itself here as far back
as 1689, a time when William III and Mary II had just come to the
throne and the cost of living was very different. A look in the
history books shows that meat then cost 3d a pound, bacon 4d, good
cheese 2d and draught ale 2d a flagon. Coffee, by contrast, was very
expensive at 3s 6d a pound and tea could cost up to 3
guineas a blend.</p>
<div style="text-indent:0em;display:inline;margin:5px 10px 0px 0px;float:left"><a href="/history/self-portrait-1989/self-portrait-0/p007a.png" imageanchor="1"><img border="0" height="240" src="/history/self-portrait-1989/self-portrait-0/p007a.png" width="320" /></a></div>
<p>1733 is the date cited by a second resident as the year in which
Souldern became the home for her family. By then George II was on the
throne. Cockfighting was a regular pastime during this period and gin
drinking was ‘out of control’ according to the
historians. Indeed, Oxford had an alehouse for every 60 persons! In
1889 a local newspaper reported a petition signed by 74 villagers
against a renewal of the licence of the Bulls Head public house (now
the garage) on the grounds that a village of under 500 was already
adequately served by four pubs and a beer house, without the need for
a sixth!</p>
<p>A further two dozen Souldern families go back more than
one hundred years, which must be quite a record when it is considered
how much villages are changing today with fewer and fewer jobs in the
countryside.</p>
<p>The most recent families to move into Souldern, at the time of the
questionnaire, have been in the village for just 2 months and they
join more than a dozen who report that they moved into the parish
during the last 9 months. Over 30 people have lived in Souldern less
than 2 years.</p>
<p>Interestingly, once families move to the village they tend to
stay. Almost 40 people have lived in Souldern between 6 and 10 years
and 32 people indicated they have made their home here for between 11
and 20 years. Over 50 people have lived here between 20 and 50
years. Perhaps the peace and quiet and honest friendliness of our village
are just a few of the reasons.</p>
<h3 style="text-indent:0em"><a name="TOC-EMPLOYMENT"></a>EMPLOYMENT</h3>
<p style="text-indent:0em">Up until the first World War the pattern of employment in Souldern,
as in most English villages, must have changed remarkably little in
the previous several hundred years. They were all of necessity largely
self sufficient in providing for the economic needs of their
residents, the only contact with the local towns being with the
village carrier in his horse drawn van or by train. The majority of
males worked on the land as farm labourers or gardeners, but there
were also tradesmen such as builders, blacksmiths, saddlers, cobblers,
as well as the carpenter who doubled as wheelwright and
undertaker. Added to these would be the teachers, the parson and the
priest, and a postman who walked to and from Aynho station three times
daily except on Sundays. Younger women worked mainly as domestic
servants until they married; all the larger houses employed one or
more. It was unusual for married women to work outside the home but
lacemaking provided meagre pinmoney for some and a few would take in
washing and ironing for the better off.</p>
<p>Souldern Manor was a major employer, with grooms, gardeners and
several indoor staff, while Manor Farm had as many as ten men and boys
all the year round. The smaller farms tended to be worked by the owner
and his family, but in addition accounted for an extra six or seven
workmen. All the larger houses had one or more gardeners and
maids. Older residents remember that it was not uncommon to see a
dozen or so young men kicking a ball about in the main street
during their dinner hour, there being no traffic to worry about.</p>
<div style="text-indent:0em;display:inline;margin:5px 10px 0px 0px;float:left"><a href="/history/self-portrait-1989/self-portrait-0/p008a.png" imageanchor="1"><img border="0" height="194" src="/history/self-portrait-1989/self-portrait-0/p008a.png" width="320" /></a></div>
<p>The Appraisal reveals what a big change has occurred during the
last sixty or seventy years. The first pie diagram shows the
employment situation today. There has been a big influx of retired
people who now make up approximately one in three of the residents,
while the proportion of children is much less; Bob Hitchman remembers
that he was one of about eighty on the school roll in his day.</p>
<div style="text-indent:0em;display:inline;margin:5px 10px;float:right"><a href="/history/self-portrait-1989/self-portrait-0/p008b.png" imageanchor="1"><img border="0" src="/history/self-portrait-1989/self-portrait-0/p008b.png" /></a></div>
<p>The small fraction describing themselves as housewives is probably
an indication that many young mothers now have jobs. One in twenty is
unemployed. The second pie diagram shows the proportion of those
working in the village compared with those who have to travel to their
place of work. Here is the big change in the pattern, revealing that
most by far travel out of Souldern, but surprisingly there are still
31 jobs in the village, but presumably most of these are for women. Of
those who travel most do so by car, or by car and train, while some
nine use buses.</p>

<p style="text-indent:0em">Replies to the questionnaire paint the picture of a village of
active and involved inhabitants.
For its size and position, Souldern
is well served by, and gives support to, organisations and facilities
such as the Church, the Chapel, the two public houses, the Village
Hall Committee, the Horticultural Society, the playing field and the
recently established Nancy Bowles Wood.</p>

<p>The membership of village
committees, even though a number of individuals will be members of
more than one, does reflect on the commendably wide involvement of
people in communal village life. A number of respondents mentioned
belonging to various outside associations and groups; these are listed
in the Appendix B.</p>
<div style="text-indent:0em;display:inline;margin:5px 10px;float:right"><a href="/history/self-portrait-1989/self-portrait-0/p10a.png" imageanchor="1"><img border="0" height="162" src="/history/self-portrait-1989/self-portrait-0/p10a.png" width="200" /></a></div>
<p>Among those who replied considerable interest was expressed in local history, while 28 requested further information about existing groups and organisations. A list of addresses and points of contact is listed in the Appendix C.</p>
<p>A number of replies expressed concern about the lack of provision for young people. “What has happened to the Youth Club?” “Those aged 7-15 are not catered for". “There isn't anything to do in Souldern”. “We should have more things for young and teenaged children because we have nothing because people don't think of us because there are so many old people in the village". These reflect some of the comments made by teenage respondents.</p>
<div style="text-indent:0em;display:inline;float:left;margin:5px 10px 0px 0px"><a href="/history/self-portrait-1989/self-portrait-0/p10b.png" imageanchor="1"><img border="0" height="200" src="/history/self-portrait-1989/self-portrait-0/p10b.png" width="194" /></a></div>
<p>Several people listed the Nancy Bowles Wood as a growing asset for
leisure. “The Nancy Bowles Wood is a great catalyst and a great
triumph for the whole community … Projects like that
should be encouraged” are typical examples of this point of view,
although there were critical comments about the sometimes muddy state
of the approach and the lack of parking space at the foot of the
path. Some enjoyed the opportunity the location of the village
provides for country walks and requested details of the footpaths. We
have provided a map of the definitive paths as approved by the County
Council and as existing in the winter of 1989/90.


</p>
<p>Twenty nine people confirmed that they made regular use of the
library van and a further 87 used libraries elsewhere, at schools, at
their place of employment and in neighbouring towns.</p>
<p>Twenty four villagers attend adult education classes at the

<p>Overall, the responses to the questionnaire give a portrait of a
village in which, in spite of its small size and relative isolation,
its inhabitants live an active community and leisure life. This is a
picture which is confirmed by a glance at any time at the village
noticeboard or by a reading of any copy of that excellent monthly news
sheet, “The Three Parishes". This publication should provide any
future social historians with a very comprehensive picture of the life
of the village at this period of time.</p>
<h3 style="text-indent:0em"><a name="TOC-SERVICES-AND-FACILITIES"></a>SERVICES AND FACILITIES</h3>
<h4 style="text-indent:0em"><a name="TOC-Medical"></a>Medical</h4>
<p style="text-indent:0em">The questionnaire posed two questions on this subject: “Which
medical centre do you use?” and “How do you travel to medical
appointments?”</p>
<div style="text-indent:0em;display:inline;margin:5px 10px 0px 0px;float:left"><a href="/history/self-portrait-1989/self-portrait-0/p11a.png" imageanchor="1"><img border="0" height="148" src="/history/self-portrait-1989/self-portrait-0/p11a.png" width="200" /></a></div>
<p>Of the 212 replies to the first question, 81 indicate that they use
Bicester medical centre, 108 use Deddington, 8 use Brackley and 15 use
Upper Heyford. Of the 207 replies to the second question, 192 travel
to medical appointment by car, 14 by bus and 1 by taxi. (A reflection
on the availability of public transport in this area?).</p>
<div style="clear:both;text-indent:0em;display:block;text-align:center;margin-right:auto;margin-left:auto"><a href="/history/self-portrait-1989/self-portrait-0/p11b.png" imageanchor="1"><img border="0" src="/history/self-portrait-1989/self-portrait-0/p11b.png" /></a></div>
<p>Amongst the comments received was a request for a mini-bus to
enable those without their own transport to visit friends in hospitals
and homes nearby.</p>
<h4 style="text-indent:0em"><a name="TOC-Shopping"></a>Shopping</h4>
<p style="text-indent:0em">This analysis of the shopping section of the questionnaire return
is based on replies from 213 residents.</p>
<div style="text-indent:0em;display:inline;margin:5px 10px 0px 0px;float:left"><a href="/history/self-portrait-1989/self-portrait-0/p11c.png" imageanchor="1"><img border="0" height="166" src="/history/self-portrait-1989/self-portrait-0/p11c.png" width="200" /></a></div>
The results are illustrated in
3 diagrams set out on the next page. The first shows the extent to
which the villagers make use of the general provision section of the
store, the second of the Post Office side, and the third indicates
which are the preferred towns for major purchases. From the first we
see that I in 20 never use the shop; 3 in 4 use it occasionally and
only 1 in 5 make it their principal source of groceries. This is a
surprisingly poor support, but of course many non-villagers also make
their purchases here, and not every resident made a return anyway. The
recent closing of Aynho shop presumably brought some extra
business. From the second Pie diagram we see that the Post Office side
is much better supported by the village, with over half the returns
indicating regular use, 41% occasionally and only about 6% never using
it at all. The third diagram shows, not surprisingly, that Bicester
and Banbury are about equally favoured as shopping centres, but with
Oxford attracting some 12% of the business. Perhaps these people work
in Oxford and find it easier to shop there.


<p>This pattern of shopping contrasts very sharply with that of 70 or
so years ago as Bob Hitchman attests in his writings. At that time the
village depended almost entirely on its own shops. With labourers'
wages at sixteen shillings weekly and even a bicycle a luxury, the
housewife with a family was to a large extent a prisoner in her
home. Anything not available in the village could be collected by one
of the two carriers who made regular bi-weekly journeys to Banbury and
Bicester, charging two old pence per item for the service, but
according to size for bigger things. Mr Bates of West End was one
carrier, Mr Lett of Timber Cottage the other. Both used horse drawn
vans. There were three grocers in the village; the Boddingtons of
Great House Close were butchers and bakers and also sold sweets and
other items in their shop. The Titcombs were bakers as well as
grocers; their shop was in the premises now occupied by the Bull's
Head Garage. The third grocer was in what is now Deep Well Cottage,
rented from the Gough family by King's of Syresham; this shop supplied
groceries and paraffin among other things. The Boddingtons and
Titcombs were also smallholders, the former producing animals for
their own butchery business on the land to the rear of the shop, while
the Titcombs rented the fields known as Poor's Allotment (on either
side of the Clap Gate bridle path) from Souldern Charities.</p>
<p>Thankfully
since those days the village has become much more affluent and in
addition there has been a significant influx of retired folk who have
their own transport, the car. The supermarkets too have arrived in the
local towns, with their aggressive marketing techniques, wide choice
and low margin sales, allowing them to sell at prices which no small
business could match, hence their attraction, with the added advantage
that the home refrigerator/freezer makes it possible to buy food in
large quantities at longer intervals. Thus a once weekly visit to the
local town is enough for most people. It is not at all clear how any
village stores can survive in this fiercely competitive situation, yet
at the same time it has to be said that they perform a unique and
invaluable function in any village.</p>

<p>Certainly, Souldern villagers
appear to be very appreciative of the range of goods and services
offered and of the excellent personal service provided by the staff of
the village shop. It was mentioned as one of the things valued by a
number of respondents.</p>

<h4 style="clear:all;text-indent:0em"><a name="TOC-The-Village-Garage"></a>The Village Garage</h4>
<p style="text-indent:0em">
Two questions were asked in the questionnaire on this subject:</p>
<div style="text-indent:0em;display:inline;margin:5px 10px 0px 0px;float:left"><a href="/history/self-portrait-1989/self-portrait-0/p13b.png" imageanchor="1"><img border="0" src="/history/self-portrait-1989/self-portrait-0/p13b.png" /></a></div>
<p>“Do you buy petrol in the village?” and “Do you have your car serviced in
the village?"</p>
<p>Amongst the 194 who replied to the first question, 42 claimed to
buy petrol regularly from the village garage, 57 occasionally and 95
never. Of the 187 who replied to the second question, 57 have their
cars serviced in the village and 130 elsewhere.</p>
<p>When considering these figures, it
should be borne in mind that there are a number of business cars in
the village, many of which will have petrol and servicing accounts at
major garages in Bicester, Banbury and elsewhere. Some privately owned
cars are tied to manufacturers appointed agents, which are located
outside the village.</p>
<div style="text-indent:0em;clear:both;display:block;text-align:center;margin-right:auto;margin-left:auto"><a href="/history/self-portrait-1989/self-portrait-0/p13c.png" imageanchor="1"><img border="0" src="/history/self-portrait-1989/self-portrait-0/p13c.png" /></a></div>
<br />
<p>A number of respondents said they would use the village garage more
if unleaded petrol and diesel fuel were available.</p>
<h4 style="text-indent:0em"><a name="TOC-The-Parish-Council"></a>The Parish Council</h4>
<p style="text-indent:0em">A large majority of the comments on the Parish Council were
appreciative of its work on behalf of the village: “I value the
continuing efforts of the Parish Council and others to keep the title
‘Best Kept Village’”; “I value the public spiritedness of
the P.C.”; “We are lucky to have an excellent Parish Council and we do
not need to invite bureaucracy.” These are three typical comments,
though one respondent felt that the Council could do more to influence
the planners not to allow new developments in the village out
of keeping with the village's character.</p>
<h4 style="text-indent:0em"><a name="TOC-HOUSING"></a>HOUSING</h4>
<p style="text-indent:0em">Of the 210 people replying to
the questionnaire, only 4% failed to answer the first part of this
section. 46% did not want more housing in the village at all, 27% did
not mind and 23% said they would like to see more housing, although
there were constant provisos as to the type of housing which would be
acceptable, where it was to be built and for whom.</p>
<p>Somewhat fewer
replied to the second part as to what kind of housing the village
needs, and there was some doubt expressed that any needs
existed. Someone asked, “What needs?”, whilst another would have no
objections to development, … “provided it was tastefully done in
character with the village, but frankly I don't think it is necessary,
is it?” There is little doubt that the question of future housing
development is the one which arouses most concern and evokes widely
differing views.</p>
<div style="text-indent:0em;display:inline;float:left;margin:5px 10px 0px 0px"><a href="/history/self-portrait-1989/self-portrait-0/p14a.png" imageanchor="1"><img border="0" height="157" src="/history/self-portrait-1989/self-portrait-0/p14a.png" width="320" /></a></div>
<p>However, 47% thought that housing for young people was
needed while 22% saw a need for housing suitable for old people. Both
rented and Council housing attracted 10% of the returns and 5% wanted
the provision of flats or bedsitters. Two comments which represent
this concern were quite explicit. “… there are obviously not
enough bungalows provided here —
I know some people like to stay put,
but if those who wished to take smaller units could be provided with
some, the family houses could be re-let and some of the younger people
could continue to live here, and so even out the balance, as this
village is fast becoming a community of the very rich and elderly
folk, and not many in the younger and middle age group are able to
stay here”. And again “… we badly need more rented accommodation
and low-cost housing. Otherwise the village will become an elephant's
graveyard with no-one to keep the community going as a working
village… we must not become a retirement suburbia…”</p>
<p>Objections to any development whatsoever were registered by 20% of
those replying, some of these objections being couched in very strong
terms indeed. Two fairly typical replies were: “I would particularly
oppose any development of the village which would without doubt
destroy its unique character. Should that happen, I would certainly
move as would, I think, many others”, and “I personally would fight to
stop developers coming in and knocking down old houses etc., to
build. The new should be built around Souldern, if it's really
necessary”.</p>
<p>Although 61% would have no objections to a development to meet
local needs, there were again strong feelings expressed as to the
suitability of building, the site and user groups; almost all these
affirmative replies had some such rider, the main concerns being that
any development should not spoil the village in any way, nor attract
those who would not take part in village life. There was also some
resistance to the extra facilities, such as more shops or a bigger
garage, which such a development might bring with it, and the
potential difficulties of access and danger of over-crowded roads were
also mentioned.</p>
<p>The failure of 18.5% to reply to this part of the questionnaire at
all may point to an error in drafting the questionnaire; there was
evidence that the questions were not always fully understood.</p>
<p>The feelings predominating among those who did reply seem to be summed
up by one comment in reply to question 14: “Let us not make the common
mistake of allowing modern house construction and design to be built
on the several building plots presently available. With the advent of
the M40 more people will be looking for property in the area. We must
not let any new residents change the village either by development or
by services, i.e. another shop, larger garage, supermarket or any form
of public entertainment”.</p>
<p>There is reflected in the replies a general awareness of the
conflict between the need for some additional accommodation for young
and old to be able to live in their home village and the fact that any
commercial development would be unlikely to help local families as the
costs would be prohibitive. So yet more strangers would become
residents, resulting in more pressures for change. As one respondent
put it “…something needs doing, but, there, I don't know what!”</p>
<h4 style="text-indent:0em"><a name="TOC-ROAD-SAFETY"></a>ROAD SAFETY</h4>
<p style="text-indent:0em">The question of road safety provoked a tremendous
response. Out of a total of 213 individual questionnaires completed no
less than 92 offered a total of 147 comments on the
problem of road safety.</p>
<div style="text-indent:0em;display:inline;margin:5px 10px 0px 0px;float:left"><a href="/history/self-portrait-1989/self-portrait-0/p15a.png" imageanchor="1"><img border="0" height="208" src="/history/self-portrait-1989/self-portrait-0/p15a.png" width="320" /></a></div>
<p>Thirty six referred to the danger inherent in
parking on the hill between the A41 junction and the pond, and 30 were
concerned about the excessive speed of traffic in the village,
particularly of that coming down the hill towards the pond. Many
commented on the dangerous junction at the pond and the vulnerability
of children playing there. Nineteen suggested “Sleeping Policemen”
be installed at appropriate places and nine called for a one way
system, particularly along Back Lane and Fox Lane.</p>
<p>This comment was representative of many: “… a dangerous lack of
visibility at the exit into the staggered crossroads by the pond. To
prevent serious accidents and improve vehicular circulation it is
necessary to make Back Lane one way from the pond to Fox Lane”.</p>
<p>Eight suggested a “Drive Carefully” sign at the entrance to the
village, seven suggested provision of a car park with parking banned
on the hill, six suggested a mirror at the pond junction, four
referred to the dangers of stones implanted in verges, two suggested a
“No Through Road” sign, and finally there was a suggestion that there
should be a traffic filter on the A41 at the village junction.</p>
<p>Without doubt a very large number of villagers are concerned about
road safety in Souldern and fear that before long there will
be a serious accident in the village.</p>
<h4 style="text-indent:0em"><a name="TOC-ISSUES-OF-CONCERN"></a>ISSUES OF CONCERN</h4>
<div style="text-indent:0em;display:inline;margin:5px 10px 0px 0px;float:left"><a href="/history/self-portrait-1989/self-portrait-0/p16a.png" imageanchor="1"><img border="0" height="200" src="/history/self-portrait-1989/self-portrait-0/p16a.png" width="181" /></a></div>
<p style="text-indent:0em">The subject
which prompted the second largest response (93) was the lack of street
lighting in the village, but opinion was well divided with 52 in
favour and 41 against. Twelve referred particularly to the safety
aspect; it is clear from certain replies that some lady residents are
afraid to leave their homes after dark. “Women out alone would feel
safer with street lighting after dark”. There was also mention of the
area between the village hall and the pond as being particularly
dark at night.</p>
<div style="text-indent:0em;display:inline;margin:5px 10px;float:right"><a href="/history/self-portrait-1989/self-portrait-0/p16b.png" imageanchor="1"><img border="0" height="149" src="/history/self-portrait-1989/self-portrait-0/p16b.png" width="200" /></a></div>
<p>There were 69 comments on the subject of street names,
39 in favour of their being displayed and 30 against. No clear
consensus here! “I’m continually asked the way by delivery van drivers
and except for the High Street the other little roads are
confusing". On the question of the identification of houses, of 54
replies 36 were in favour of displayed identification (most preferring
house names to numbers) and 18 were against.</p>
<p>There were 64 responses
on the question of dog nuisance. Of these 55 objected (some very
strongly) to dogs fouling the streets, verges and other areas of the
village, particularly the recreation ground. “I would like horse and
dog owners to be much more aware and to clear up after their animals
… it is a health hazard, particularly to the young”. Only 9 felt
there was no cause for concern. “As this is a country village why
can't people stop fussing about dogs — what nuisance? The odd mess isn't
going to kill any of us”.</p>
<div style="text-indent:0em;display:inline;margin:5px 10px 0px 0px;float:left"><a href="/history/self-portrait-1989/self-portrait-0/p17a.png" imageanchor="1"><img border="0" height="172" src="/history/self-portrait-1989/self-portrait-0/p17a.png" width="200" /></a></div>
<p>Finally, there were 34 replies on the subject of Policing. The
majority (28) felt there should be greater police presence in the
village, 6 specifically wanting our own village bobby. “It would
be an asset to re-establish a village policeman (or policewoman!) to
whom we can talk and readily recognise. Someone who knows the village
residents and local problems”. Only 6 respondents expressed themselves
as being satisfied with the existing police coverage.</p>
<h4 style="clear:both;text-indent:0em"><a name="TOC-OTHER-COMMENTS"></a>OTHER COMMENTS</h4>
<p style="text-indent:0em">One group of questions asked “What would you like to see changed in
Souldern? What would you fight to preserve? What do you value in the
village?” These produced a large response with 281 individual comments
in all.</p>
<p>On the subject of changes there were 97 replies of which an
overwhelming majority (69) want no change at all! A number of those
wanting change or improvement referred to green issues.</p>
<div style="text-indent:0em;display:inline;margin:5px 10px 0px 0px;float:left"><a href="/history/self-portrait-1989/self-portrait-4/p17b.png" imageanchor="1"><img border="0" height="132" src="/history/self-portrait-1989/self-portrait-4/p17b.png" width="200" /></a></div>
<p>“Perhaps more seats could be provided around the village
… Perhaps at least one of the old pond sites could be rejuvenated
to hold wild life and a suitable waterside habitat. I would like to
the maintenance of areas specifically for wild life with perhaps a bit
less emphasis on arid mown areas of prairie grass". Nine
responders wanted more trees in the village, four more
bridleways, three wanted a ban on bonfires, two wanted bus shelters
and two wanted waste recycling facilities. “These services could cater
for re-cycling bottles, aluminium and tin cans and paper. Containers
for such a purpose could be positioned in a centrally located and
easily accessible location, e.g. behind the shop”.</p>
<div style="clear:both;text-indent:0em;display:inline;margin:5px 10px 0px 0px;float:left"><a href="/history/self-portrait-1989/self-portrait-4/p17c.png" imageanchor="1"><img border="0" height="200" src="/history/self-portrait-1989/self-portrait-4/p17c.png" width="171" /></a></div>
<p>Two people wanted
Upper Heyford Air Base removed and one each want a village school, a
golf course, meals-on-wheels, sign posting of all paths, a post box in
the area of Bovewell, more litter bins, quieter delivery van visits in
the early morning, and a central TV aerial serving all houses. On the
subject of what is valued in the village, there were 184 replies with
a much wider spread of opinion. First and foremost, 41 value the
character of the
village and 28 the friendliness of the residents. Twenty-six
appreciate its quietness and 18 the fact that the village is sited as
a “No Through Road”. Seventeen particularly mentioned the service of
the Post Office Stores and 13 the part played by the village
church. Ten mentioned the value of the garage, eight the Nancy Bowles
Wood, five the Fox Inn, four the Village Hall, three the footpaths and
one the mobile vans which visit the village. Six respondents objected
to the noise from Upper Heyford Air Base and four considered the bus
service inadequate.</p>
