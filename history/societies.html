<p>There have been many incarnations of a Horticultural society in Souldern going back to at least 1905, when there was a society for Aynho and Souldern. <a href="/horticultural-society">The present society</a> was started in 1981 and has the distinction of being a club with a 
membership consisting of nearly the whole of Souldern. An annual show is arranged in August when members are 
able to compete for cups for their produce etc. </p>

<p>There is no longer a WI in Souldern. The last President was Mrs Diana Gray. TheÂ  photograph shows the Souldern WI on an outing in 1933.</p>

<h2 id="TOC-Souldern-Club">Souldern Club</h2>
<p>This was a working men's club formed in 1816 and was in being for over 
100 years. In 1886 it had a membership of 84. Each member paid an 
admission fee of 5/- and afterwards 4/- a quarter. The payment during 
illness was 9/- per week for the first year and 4/6 per week thereafter.
 Wages at that time were approximately 14/- per week.</p>
<p>The club had a feast day annually on the 29th May, when everyone wore oak leaves. There
 was a parade, followed by a Church Service when most men carried a pole
 and some wore a bowler hat. The day continued with a good meal and a 
visit to Coky Smiths Fair which was set up on The Green.</p>
<p>The tradition of celebrating <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oak_Apple_Day" rel="nofollow">Oak Apple Day</a> has recently been resurrected with a biannual meeting with games at <a href="/recreational-areas/nancy-bowles-wood">Nancy Bowles Wood</a></p>
