 <h1>Robert Jones: Rector of Souldern (1787-1835)</h1>
<h2>By BRONAC HOLDEN</h2>

<h3>SUMMARY</h3>
<p>
Robert Jones is both an interesting and a puzzling person. He was an
intimate friend of William Wordsworth from their University days at St
John's College, Cambridge. Joxes was athletic, friendly, affable and
good company; he was the companion of Wordsworth on his three thousand
mile walking tour through Evrope in 1791. During his adult life he and
the Wordsworths repeatedly visited one another and he accompanied them
on several tours through Wales, but as the years wet by he became
overweight and out of condition, withdrawn but constant in his
friendship and love for William as was William in his regard for
Jones. From the onset of has appointment lo the church of St Mars,
Sowe , fones did is best to delay actually setting there, offering ONE
Softer another to the Bishop of Ongond as to why he should have low of
absence, managing to spend almost all of his entire wyrwis ar Diether
he actually in Souden heran dah and the Best in 1822 Witoli Robust to
o Wales lang the cene ar Sondern incenate's hands. E ntusily the
Bishop had to be the cut outhorities to deal with any imes while
Robert, still in se Rector of St Mary's, continued to live comfortably
at his family home in Wales
</p>

<p>In 1622 Dr John Williams, Bishop of Lincoln, bestowed a substantial
endowment upon I St John's College, Cambridge. He had already founded
four scholarships and two fellowships in Westminster school, two of
which were for persons born in Wales; he now founded four scholarships
and two fellowships in St John's College, Cambridge for the further
advancement of these scholars. He then purchased lands and the
perpetual donation and patronage of four benefices, one of which was
the cure of Souldern.<sup>1</sup> To these benefices the holders of his fellowships
were in due course to be presented. And so it came about that in 1806
Robert Jones, Fellow of St John's, was presented to the Church of
Souldern.</p>

<p>Robert Jones' claim to fame today is that he was a close friend of
William Wordsworth They both entered St John's College, Cambridge,
Robert in June and William in October 1787. Jones was, like William, a
second son and destined for the church. They both shared a passion for
poetry, mountains and walking. William took only the subjects which
interested him while Robert had dropped to the third class by the end
of his first year.<sup>2</sup> Instead of studying during the summer vacation of
1790, William and Robert decided on a walking tour of Europe with the
objective of reaching the Swiss Alps.<sup>3</sup></p>

<p>Many years later Wordsworth wrote 'In the month of August 1790 I
set oft for the continent, in companionship with Robert Jones, a
Welshman, a fellow-collegian. We went stall in hand without knapstes
and carrying cach his needments tied up in a pocket handkerchief, with
about twenty pounds a piece in our pockets. For what seemed best to me
worth recording in this tour, see the Poem of my own Life The Prelude
Book 6.<sup>4</sup></p>

<p>Not even Wordsworth's sister Dorothy was told and later she wrote hid he acquainted me with his whene before its execution should have looked upon it mad and impracticable.<sup>5</sup></p>


<p>Despite Wordsworth's recollection of leaving for the continent in
August, records, and indeed a letter of his own written in 1790, show
that they spent the night of 12 July at Dover and the next day crossed
to France arriving at Calais on the eve of the celebrations of the 11
July;<sup>6</sup> this eventful day made little impression on the two young men
as all their thoughts were of poetry, nature and their walking
tour.<sup>7</sup> Between July and late September 1790 the two undergraduates
travelled nearly three thousand miles, walking at least two thousand
of them at a rate of more than thirty a day. From Calais they walked
almost duc south to Chalon-surSaône, a march it was of military
speed<sup>8</sup> where they hired a boat to travel down the Rhine to a little
below Lyon. Then they trekked across country visiting the Grande
Chartreuse, Geneva and the Lakes, passing through the Simplon Pass and
reaching Lake Maggiore, Lake Como and on through North Italy, then to
Basel where they bought about and sold it again on reaching
Cologne. From there they went on fool through Belgium and finally
home.<sup>9</sup></p>


<p>From Kesswil, Switzerland, Wordsworth tells Dorothy 'we have
several times performed a journey of thirteen leagues (40 miles) over
the most mountainous parts of Swisserland.<sup>10</sup></p>

<p>They lived frugally and travelled light, and thirty years later
Robert recalls 'We were early risers in 1790 and generally walker 12
or 15 miles before breakfast and after feasting on the morning
Landscape how we afterwards feasted on our Dejeuner of whatever the
house might afford<sup>11</sup>. The whole escapade was a remarkable achievement
showing great courage and stamina, both physical and mental and it
made a very strong bond between the pair.</p>

<p>Twenty-five years later Jones declared to Wordsworth 'I can assure
you that a Day seldom passes that I do not think of you will feelings
of inexpressibile allection.<sup>12</sup> Wordsworth, who had, with great feeling
dedicated his work, Descript Sherches (which recounted their memorable
tour), to Robert,<sup>13</sup> was equally fond of him; their friendship was to
endure until Robert's death in 1835.</p>

<p>By the middle of October they were both back at Cambridge, with
only a few short months left to prepare for their chegree
examination.</p>

<p>In January 1791 one hundred and forty undergraduates were examined:
William and Robert being among those unplaced in order of
merit.<sup>14</sup> William did not want to go into the church: Jones secured one
of the Welsh fellowships offered by St John's and was able to return
to his wealthy home in Denbighshire. He obtained his M.A. in the same
year and his B.D. in 1791 and was ordained at the age of twenty-three,<sup>15</sup></p>

<p>By the middle of May 1791 William, wearing of London and short of
money decided to visit his friend Robert at Robert's family home,
Plas-yn-1.lan, at Llangynhafal,
Denbighshire<sup>16</sup> The Jones' lived in the house by the church in a glorious
situation high on the Clwydan range of mountains.<sup>17</sup> According to one
description Jones' home was rambling Tudor house with a courtyard. The
most impressive house in the neighbourhood beautifully situated,<sup>18</sup>
although Wordsworth, according to Dorothy called it quite a cottage
just such a one would suits and she adds and how sweetly situated in
the most delicious of all Vales, the Vale of Clwyd!'<sup>19</sup></p>

<p>On 26 June 1791 Dorothy Wordsworth wrote to her close friend Jane Pollard
I often hear from my brother William who is now in Wales where I think
he seems happy that it is probable he will remain there all summer, or
a great part of it, who would not be happy enjoying the company of
three young ladies in the Vale of Clewyd and without rival? His friend
Jones is a charming young man and has FIVE SISTERS, three of whom are
at home at present, then there are mountains, rivers, woods and rocks,
whose charms without any other inducement would be sufficient to tempt
William to continue amongtas long as possible.<sup>20</sup></p>

<p>While enjoying the summer the two young men explored North Wales,
met the noted travel writer Thomas Pennant and stirred by Pennant's
description of an acent of Snowdon decided to climb it at night in
order to see the sun rise from its peak.<sup>21</sup> Wordsworth gives a vivid
description of this climb in Book 14 of the Prelude balancing it with
the Crossing of the Alps in Book 6.<sup>22</sup></p>

<p>In 1792 William was once again in France walking extensively along
the banks of the Loire and he invited Robert to join him at
Blois. Robert, however, decided to take up a teaching pool at Bangor
which would keep him in Wales until Christmas.<sup>23</sup></p>

<p>In 1793 an old school friend of William wanted to make a tour of
the west of England and Wales and invited William to accompany him
offering to pay his travelling expenses Wordsworth was delighted to do
so. Unfortunately when they were approaching Salisbury they had an
accident in which their light gig was smashed beyond repHis friend
Calvert decided to ride back home but William continued on foot
alone. On aching Wales he travelled north and by the 30 August arrived
at Jones' home where, Dorothy notes in a letter to her friend Jane 'he
is now quietly sitting down in the Vale of Clwyd...and passes his time
as happily as he could desire with his Friend Jones the companion of
his continental Tour.<sup>24</sup></p>

<p>Robert frequently visited the Wordsworths both at Grasmere and
later at Rycal Mount: in both places Robert would have met many of the
Wordsworth's illustrious friends, among them Sir Walter Scott and
William Coleridge. In September of 1800Jones visited Grasmere on the
15th and then again a few days later. Jones returned again on the
Friday 19th September Jones stayed with us until Friday 26th September
Coleridge came on Tuesday 23rd and went home with Jones.<sup>25</sup></p>

<p>Blomfield mistakenly suggests that Robert went abroad again with
Wordsworth in 1802.<sup>26</sup> But Blomfield had based his supposition on the
sunnet Wordsworth wrote on that occasion which, though addressed to
Jones, was referring not to Wordsworth's current journey from Calaista
Ardres but to that other one in 1790.</p>

<p>Jones, as com Calais southwards you and I<br/>
Went pacing side by side this public way.<br/>
Streamed with the pomp ota too credulous day<br/>
When faith was pledged to new-born liberty<sup>27</sup></p>

<p>Wordsworth is referring of course to Bastille Day, July, 1790.</p>

<p>Such was the young man, athletic, intelligent and charming who was
appointed to St Mary's Souldern in December 1806. He continued however
to live at his home, Plasyn Llan but set things in motion to improve
the money payment in lieu of tithes which, based in the 17th century
on the then prevailing price of com, was now worth very little. In a
letter to St John's, Cambridge he writes:</p>

<p>at the beginning of my Incumbency I set aside an old composition
which was paid and acquiesced in by my more immediate predecessor
M. Horseman and all his predecessors for the last ISO years. The old
composition for tithes amounted to 199 and their present value is
considerably more than 300 per annum besides the Glebe which consists
of about 135 acres'.<sup>28</sup></p>

<p>A paper of c, 1800 compiled by Mr. Bond, St John's Burst states In
Soulderne Parish there are ce of enclosed clebe arable and about
lacres pasture, with anchand, two kitchen gardens and Churchyard. In
all about 11 actes contiguous to the House.<sup>29</sup></p>

<p>In March 1807 Robert Jones wrote to Bishop Charles Moss this living
has for a long time laboured under the disadvantage of a fixed money
payment by no means adequate to the present value of the Tithes which
hath been quietly used in by former Rectors.'<sup>30</sup></p>

<p>In fact Mr. Horseman's son had stated that &ldquo;My Father always supposed
that the decrce in Chancery might be set aside, but was deterre from
making the attempt by the fear of the expense and consequent ill will
of the parishioners. For his forbearance he never received any
compliment or compensation. His nation was that the living might be
doubled&rdquo;<sup>31</sup></p>

<p>This notion was correct: Mr. Bond reported that the value of the
living in c. 1800 Was £195 and with Taxes and Tenth deducted was £170,
but that in his opinion if the 1.270 acres of land divided between
arable and grass were properly tithed, at say by an acre for arable
and is an acte for grass, then the net value would be 385 15. Od</p>

<p>William Wing wrote of Horseman. This me and quaint character while
he fought successfully the battles of his clerical brethren against
the Tapacity of lay landowners and impropriators, so neglected his own
privileges as Rector of Souldern, that his immediate Successor raised
the value of his incumbency at least 200 per annum by simply looking
after his just revenues.'<sup>33</sup></p>

<p>In the letter of March 1807 already mentioned Robert asks for a
certificate of nonresidence on the grounds that the buildings were
dilapidated and because of incipient fears of hostility from his
parishioners over his attempt to improve the rate of payment in lieu
ol tithes</p>

<p>He wrote again on 17 March from Wales stating that his curate Sir
William Clerke was looking after the Parish, and that he had not yet
signed the Bill for the ending of the Parish of Fritwell 'but that the
enclosure should be highly advantageous to the Living of Souldern<sup>34</sup></p>

<p>By April he had gone to Cambridge to consult with the Master and
Senior Fellows about selling some property in Fritwell in order to
redeem the land tax on the Rectory of Souldern.<sup>35</sup></p>

<p>It is not dear whether Robert received a certificate of
non-residence or not but he continued to live in Wales occasionally
visiting Cambridge Writing again from Cambridge in May 1807 he stated
that his glebe consisted of ll acres in Soulder and about 60 statute
acres in the open fields of Fritwell, of which he proposed selling
about 8 res near the village of Fritwell along with the cottage and
garden in the same parish. He reckoned on getting £30 per acre,
sufficient to redeem the land tax in both parishes:</p>

<p>my allotment in Fritwell if the Enclosure Bill has passed will be
within a quarter of a mile of the house and home stall at Souldern and
only separated from the Souldern part of the Glebe by the Turnpike
road from Bicester to Anho; nor will any new Building be necessary in
consequence of the Enclosure.<sup>36</sup></p>

<p>Between March 1807 and January of the following year there was a
constant exchange of letters between the Bishop and Robert, the latter
continuing his plea for a certificate of nonresidence, chiefly on the
grounds that the house was not fit for habitation. There had been in
the early 19th century an increase of legislative activity concerning
clerical residence<sup>37</sup> so it was not surprising that by October 1807
Bishop Charles' patience was wearing very thin. He asked Robert to
explain his continued non residency: The rough draft of his letter
begins, 'Sir, I am not a little surprised at the tener of your letter
and particularly after the Indulgence I have shown you' and went on to
point out that the house had been inhabited by his predecessor until
the day of his death. He went on to ask that if repairs were needed
why had they not been done that summer. He continues I might have
deferred summoning you to residence for a few weeks until you had been
a twelve month in possession of your preferment had it not been for an
injunction which I had lately received from the Prive Council. He ends
by saying that he would have to bring the provisions of the Residence
Act against him if he did not immediately take up residence in
Souldern, and in a postscript to his secretary lets his annoyance
towards Robert show by adding I would omit the mention of authority
because, if he does not know it already, he will soon find out)<sup>38</sup></p>

<p>Robert's reply was curt. He was engaged in a Curacy in the
neighbourhood of his home. Sir William Clerke took very good care of
the church at Souldern; the house was no fit habitation for a clergy
man and that he meant to do something about it the following summer
and would set out for Souldern the following day'.<sup>39</sup></p>

<p>Mr. Bond in his report to Cambridge had said nothing about the
house being uninhabitable, just that &ldquo;The house is of stone, rough as
to workmanship, old and rather lange, the ground rooms awkwardly
disposed&rdquo;.<sup>40</sup></p>

<p>Robert's letter in November (from Souldern) ends on an arrogant
note: it is perhaps unnecessary for me to add that by quitting my
usual Place of Residence for this place immediately after the Receipt
of your Lordship's letter of the 24th of last month and complying with
your wishes which I am not more (less crossed out in duty bound than
by Inclination disposed to do lam selur from laying the Residence Act
in force against me that I am saving you that trouble.'<sup>41</sup></p>

<p>According to a terrier of the dwelling house at that time was 'new
built, with two Barnes and a stable in good repair</p>

<p>Blomfield fills in the clails sying that the Pre Relormation house
consisted of a hall in the centre with a soler at one end, and a
buttery, cellar and kitchen at the other. A small Staircise with a
small projecting gable in the centre of the house, led out of the hall
into the lupper apartments and that Mr. Harding, rector (1642-18) had
added to it on the south side the parsonage house referred to as
&ldquo;new-built.&rdquo;'<sup>42</sup></p>

<p>&ldquo;The Churchwandens in their yearly returns from the late 18th century
and during Robert's tenancy always stated that the Church and
Parsonage House and outhouses thereto belonging are in good
repair'. It was not until 1828 that they hotel all well excepting the
Rectory House now under repair but nearly finished'.<sup>43</sup></p>

<p>In January 1808 Robert invokes the Gilbert Act which allowed money
to be advanced or borrowed for the repair or rebuilding of premises
for the benefit of the clergy and once again asks for a Licence of
absence.<sup>44</sup> The Bishop caucus replies hat he would be delighted to enable
him to raise the necessary money but that he must first receive the
proper papers and proof that the work had actually begun. He makes the
further proviso that Robert is to stay in the neighbourhood either in
Souldern itself or in a neighbouring parish, adding as a parting
shot. I see no reason for your removing to a distance, and it
certainly will be in your interest that the workmen should be under
your constant and immediate view and attendance.<sup>45</sup></p>

<p>This reply in no way suited Robert who now wrote at length to ask
for a licence for nonresidency until May 1809. He explained that he
could not properly fultil his duties at Souldern while the repairs
were going on, that he really had to go to Wales to live with his
mother one of the best of mothers who is far advanced in years and
with his sisters, that he would be usefully employed as curate as
before. He repeats that no one could serve the parish of Souldern
better than his curate, Sir William Clerke, who was resident at
Fritwell and that since anyway the farmers were so incensed at the
recent enforcement of his rights recarding tithes that it would be
better if he staverlaway until a little time and absence would
ellectually heal their irritation. He had forgotten that he had said
in an earlier letter that 'All the occupiers and proprietors of land
in the Parish have at last agreed not to resist my
claims<sup>46</sup>) He ends by laying out the value of the living the
composition for the came to $135; his will then be 4631 and after
deductions for various taxes and interest and part of the Principal of
£500 raised for repairs, he would have a net income of £500 a
year.<sup>47</sup> The Bishop gave in and issued a licence of absence
until March 1809.<sup>48</sup></p>

<p>It would seem that the Bishop and Jones were al cross purposes; the
Parsonage (Fig. 1) was evidently adequate for living in but Jones was
perhaps thinking on the lines of Wordsworth's (and Coleridge's) view
that among the benefits from a Church establishment of endowments
Corresponding with the wealth of the county to which it belongs, may
be reckoned as eminently important, the examples of civility and
refinement which the dery ... afford to the whole people Wordsworth
adds that the established clergy were the principal bulwar against
barbarism.'</p>

<p>He continues with a description of his ideal, a parsonage house
generally stands not far from the church this proximity imposes
favourable restraints, and sometimes suggests an affecting union of
the accommodations and elegancies of life with outward signs of piety
and mortality'.</p>

<p>He added: &ldquo;The precincts of an old residence must be treated
by ecclesiastics with respect both from prudence and
necessity'.<sup>49</sup> Possibly influenced by this view Robert
proceeded to spend the money raised by improving the south front
rather than making interior changes.<sup>50</sup> The terrier of 1811
describes the house as slated, with a dairy adjoining and two thatched
stables and a pleasure ground in front of the house. A barn of two
bays and a
Cowhouse, both thatcher, were built by Jones in 1810 as were tanslated
necessaries and a stone walled garden for fruit trees on the north,
extending from the north-east to the northwest, which with an already
existing orchard and nursery for trees comprised two acres of land;
furthermore there also existed the daily round paddock a spinney and
an established pond all together extending over more than three
acres.</p>

<p>Earlier in 1808 in lintwell Jones had built a slated Barn of five Bays
with a slated stable adjoining it between 1808 and 1809 he had had
extensive quickset hedges set up in the glebe at Fitwell. In 1810 he
built two thatched hovels and walled with stone both the tarmyard and
the Slackyard.<sup>51</sup></p>

<p>How much all this test is not known; the original amount horrowed
was $662 66 10d.<sup>52</sup> a strangely precise amount later Jones was to
explain his mounting debts on these improvements.</p>

<p>Presumably Jones took up residence in March 1809 when his licence
for absence expired, but the first sign that he was actually living in
Souldert was in 1810 when he attended a Vestry meeting for the first
time;<sup>53</sup> for the next thirteen years according to his own statement he
remained in Souldern.<sup>54</sup></p>

<p>In July 1820 Wordsworth and a group of friends decided to re-trace
the steps of his earlier tour across France and Switzerland. On their
journey to Dover they visited Soulder where they found their once
athletic friend grown soft and very fat, no longer it for a walking
tour even if he had been free to go while they were in Soulder news
that Robert's mother had died reached them and leaving his friends
Robert hastened to Plas-y-Llan.<sup>55</sup></p>

<p>Wordsworth was impressed by Robert's dwelling which so dosely
exemplified his own views on how a parsonage should look and while
there composed a sonnet entitled A Pr o fonde in which he comments in
a philosophical manner on the bence of dividing wall or boundary
between the churchyard (Fig. 2) and his friend's garden.<sup>56</sup>
In later years he recalled the visit: 'With pleasure I recall... the
residence of an old and muchvalued friend in Oxfordshire. The house
and church stand parallel to each other, at a small distance a
circular law or rather ras plot spreads between them shrubs and tres
curve from each side of the dwelling, veiling, but not hiding, the
church. From the front of this dwelling. so part of the burial-ground
is seen, but as you wind by the side of the shrubs towards the
secple-end of the church, the eye catches a single, small low,
monumental headstone, moss-grown, sinking into and gently inclining
towards the earth. Advance, and the churchyard, populous and with
glittering tombstones, opens up on the view.'<sup>57</sup> This Visit in 1820 was
the only time that Wordsworth came to Souldern, all other meetings
between the two friends took place elsewhere.</p>

<p>In 1816 Edmund Legge succeeded Bishop Charles as Bishop of Oxford
in June 1822 Robert wrote a rather frantic letter to him concerning
his fears of his own imminent arrest for debt.<sup>58</sup> It is clear from this
letter that Robert had been living well beyond his means. He put down
his money difficulties to debts incurred in repairing the rectory
which he had estimated at £500.<sup>59</sup> He had however also erected several
buildings and walls of stone in Fritwell in spite of his assertion in
his letter of May 1807, 'nor will any new Buildings be necessary in
consequence of the Inclosure'.<sup>60</sup></p>

<p>When in 1808 he had been granted permission to raise the necessary
money he had considered a little over 500 to be sufficient. An
indenture had been drawn up between him and Henry Churchill of
Deddington for a loan to Robert of 5662 6.10. to be repaid at a rate o
n 10 M. per centum if Robert continued to reside in Souldern or 100
per centum if he did not.<sup>61</sup> He had had 15 years to repay and according
to him a gross income of £500,<sup>62</sup> though in an earlier letter he had put
his income at 1613 gross and 500 net<sup>63</sup>) His debts now mounted to over
£3,000<sup>64</sup> an enormous sum even if he had underestimated the cost of all
his rebuilding.</p>

<p>His letter to Bishop Lesse written in the third person mentions
that some of his creditors have had recourse to legal measures and
your Petitioner hath just cause to fear that his Person will very
shortly be arrested and lodged in one of his Majesty's Prisons whereby
the Parishioners will be deprived of their Minister The Bishop
realised that he had to accept Robert Jones' suggestion that the
Reverend Francis Clerke, fellow of All Souls, should act as
curate in Souldem for a stipend of £55 . Od with the surplice fees and
use of the Rectory house, arden and office, with a further allowance
of 60 . towards payment of taxes, and allowed Robert leave of absence
until December 1823.<sup>65</sup> In fact Robert never returned to Soulder and
Francis Clerke continued to look after the parish until 1826 when he
was succeeded by another fellow of All Soul's College, JA Walpole,
followed by W. Cotton Risley fellow of New College, whose stipend was
raised to $700 0d.<sup>66</sup></p>

<p>There are two documents extant for February 1825: the first is a
writ of fieri falas de bonis coclesiasticis by which the creditor of a
Church of England incumbent could obtain payment out of the profits of
the incumbent's benefice when he had no assets of his own. One of
Jones creditors must have been Lambert Molony of Boulogne-sur-Mer,
France, because it seems that he obtained a judgement in court against
Robert Jones. Having obtained judgement, a writ to the Sheriff of
Oxford against Jones' goods would have followed. The Sheriff would
then have made the return that Jones had no goods or chattels out of
which the debt could be satisfied, but that Jones was the incumbent of
the benefice of Souldern.<sup>67</sup></p>

<p>Next a writ was issued against the Bishop of Oxford for Jones'
debt to be paid from the benefice of Souldern. The Bishop then 
issued a warrant of sequestration to sequestrator, in this case 
Lambert Molony. Next this warrant was affixed on or near the
named church door in Souldern. The Bishop remained personally
responsible for the execution of the write and the warrant of
sequestration was merely his direction to his agent (Molony) to do
what the court had ordered him to do. The second document extant is a
bond given by Molony to the Bishop as security for the obligations he
will have assumed as sequestrator Lambert Molony was bound to provide
out of the profits of the bencfice for all outings of the Rectory as
well as for the performance of divine service. Once all debes were
discharged Molony would have been released from his bond.<sup>68</sup></p>

<p>By June 1822 Robert had become an absentee Rector and had settled
comfortably in Wales. Evidently his 'inconsiderable landed property
being entailed<sup>69</sup> was safe from the creditors he had left behind.</p>

<p>Robert had long been pressing the Wordsworths to visit him in Wales
and now in the summer of 1824 they were at last free to do so. On 24
August they set out from Rydal Mount and eventually reached Llanrwst
in the Vale of Conway where they had arranged to meet Robert. They
were delighted to see him again, and as he had brought his carriage
and a servant it not only made travelling more comfortable but they
moved at a lesurely pace which suited everybody Jones came into his
own with his knowledge of Welsh and his good temper soothed William's
vibility which surfaced when travelling: altogether he was the best
tempered Creature imaginable.<sup>70</sup> Jones introduced them to his friends
in the Vale of Clwyd and to the famous Ladies of Llangollen Lady
Eleanor Butler and the Hon. Sarah Ponsonby They retraced William and
Robert's earlier steps across Snowdonia, revisited Beddgelert, from
whence the two had made their midnight scent of Snowelon thirty-three
years earlier, finally parting after thirteen days journeying at
Devil's Bridge.<sup>71</sup></p>

<p>Robert still managed to get into financial difficulties, in 1825
Drothy Wordsworth had the unpleasant duty of writing to Robert about a
sum of money owed to her brother, though she widened the request, by
implicitly inviting him to Rydal Mount again.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Did you or did you not remitto Masterman and Co the little sum (I
believe about t80s. Od.) which you wel my brother ... I tell him,' she
wrote diplomatically, that you have intended coming this summer, and
settling all in such a much plesunter and more convenient way than
through the medium of Bankers yourself by the fireside at Rycial
Mount. Will you trust yourself again to my guidance to the top of one
of our Mountains? Or did I give you too much of it last time:<sup>72</sup></p>

<p>A letter from Dorothy in October 1825 speaks of Robert's liking for
quiet enjoyment rather than bustling pleasures and calls Glyn Marvin
where he had a curacy the Valley of Meditation'.<sup>73</sup> Already in 1824
Wordsworth had noted his friend plumpness, rudy cheeks and smiling
countenance and that he seemed to those who met him 'little suited to
a hermit living in the Vale of Meditation'.<sup>74</sup></p>

<p>In May 1826 Wordsworth regretted that he had no hope of visiting
Wales that year as they had had notice to quit Rydal Mount (which did
not in the event happen but he begs leis friend to come and see us, we
are growing old and ought to make the best of our time to keep up long
tried affection.<sup>75</sup> Sara Hutchinson wrote in September of that year from
Rsdal Mount 'we are threatened with a visit from Mi Coleridge, and
have had a letter proposing il visit from William's Welsh friend
Mr. Jones.'<sup>76</sup></p>

<p>By 1832 when Jones once again visited the Wordsworths at Rydal
Mount Dorothy paints picture of him 'fat and roundabout and rosy, and
pulling and panting while he climbs the little hill from the road to
our house'.<sup>77</sup> This along with a letter of Dorothy's written to him in
October 1825 where she says 'we really were not sorry that you did not
arrive in the course of last summer for you would have had to quiet
enjoyment ind you are holde for bustling pleasures' gives a picture of
a person grown indolent, out of condition and inclined to
introspection, far different from the vigorous athletic person always
ready for a walking tour in the company of his close friend.<sup>78</sup></p>

<p>Robert was still in name Rector of Souldern: licences for
non-residence subsequent to the one issued for June 1822 to December
1829 are either not extant or were NCVCT inice: however licences do
exist spanning the vers from March 1831 to 1896. the last issued in
March 1535 just a month before Robert's death.<sup>79</sup> I would seem that he
lived more or less permanently in Wales leaving the care of the parish
to others.</p>

<p>Robert Jones died in April 1835 at Plas-yn-Llan; a notice appeared
in the june issue of the Gentleman's Magazine to that effect.<sup>80</sup> Memorials
to some of the Rectors of Souldern are in be found in the church but no
sign of affection or memorial followed Robert's death. Wordsworth
wrote of their friendship 'Much of the latter part of his life he
passed in cumparative solitude, which I know was often cheered by
remembrance of our youthful adventures, and of the beautiful regions
which allume and abroad we had visile legether Our long friendship was
never subject to a moments interruption, and while revising these
volumes for the last time, I have been so often reminded of my loss
with a not unpleasing sadness that I trust the reader will excuse
mention of a man who well reserves me something more than so brief a
notice.'<sup>81</sup></p>

<p>Wordsworth, who fell things deeply, was still moved to tears two years later while at Lake Como in 1837. '
Alake Como memories of Robert Jones' (and of Mary and Dorothy on the
1820 tour) Game upon him as fresh as if they had happened the day
before wrote Dora and that William had confessed to her 'I kept to
myself and very often could for my heart's relief have burst into
tears.<sup>82</sup></p>

<p>As early as 1820 Wordsworth had summed up this complex friend in
his poem</p>

<p>
A Character<sup>83</sup></p>

<p>I marvel how Nature could ever find space<br/>
For so many strange contrases in one human face<br/>
There's throught, and 10 thought, there's plenes and bloom<br/>
And buste Suy gishness. pleasure and gloom.</p>

<p>There's a n onth both undant and vain<br/>
Such strength as il ever adiction and pain<br/>
Could pierce through a temper that's soft to disease.<br/>
Would be rational peace a philosopher's ease</p>

<p>There's indifference, alike when he fails or succeeds<br/>
And attention full ten times as much as there needs;<br/>
Pride where there's no envy, there's so much of joy<br/>
And mildness, and spirit both forward and coy.</p>

<p>There's freedom, and sometimes a diffident stare<br/>
Of shame scarcely seeming to know that she's there,<br/>
There's virtue, the title it surely can claim<br/>
Yet wants heaven knows what to be worthy the name</p>

<p>This picture from Nature may seem to depart,<br/>
Yet the man would at once run away from your heart;<br/>
And I for five centuries right guy wuld be<br/>
Such an odd, such a kind happy creature, as he.</p>

<h3>ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS</h3>

<p>I would like to thank the Acling Editor and Dr. Kate Tiller for
their advice and encouragement, and I am also grateful to Susanna
Meadway, Barrister for her explanation of sequestration anders and
other apex of erclesiastical law.</p>
