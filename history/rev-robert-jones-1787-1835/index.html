<h1>Robert Jones: Rector of Souldern (1787&ndash;1835)</h1>
<h2>By BRONAC HOLDEN</h2>


<h3>SUMMARY</h3>
<p><i> Robert Jones is both an interesting and a puzzling person. He
was an intimate friend of William Wordsworth from their University
days at St John&rsquo;s College, Cambridge. Joxes was athletic, friendly,
affable and good company; he was the companion of Wordsworth on his
three thousand mile walking tour through Europe in 1791. During his
adult life he and the Wordsworths repeatedly visited one another and
he accompanied them on several tours through Wales, but as the years
wet by he became overweight and out of condition, withdrawn but
constant in his friendship and love for William as was William in his
regard for Jones. From the onset of has appointment lo the church of
St Mary, Souldern, Jones did is best to delay actually setting there,
offering one reason after another to the Bishop of Oxford as to why he
should have leave of absence, managing to spend almost half of his
tenure away from his parish.  During the thirteen years he actuall
spent in Soulden he ran up a massive debt and the Bishop in 1822 Was
obliged to allow Robert to retire to
Wales leavig the cure of Souldern in a curates&rsquo;s hands. Eventually the Bishop
had to involve the civil athorities to deal with monetary issues while Robert,
still in name Rector of St Mary&rsquo;s, continued to live comfortably at his
family home in Wales.</i></p>

<p><b>I</b>n 1622 Dr John Williams, Bishop of Lincoln, bestowed a
substantial endowment upon St John&rsquo;s College, Cambridge. He had
already founded four scholarships and two fellowships in Westminster
school, two of which were for persons born in Wales; he now founded
four scholarships and two fellowships in St John&rsquo;s College, Cambridge
for the further advancement of these scholars. He then purchased lands
and the perpetual donation and patronage of four benefices, one of
which was the cure of Souldern.<sup>1</sup> To these benefices the
holders of his fellowships were in due course to be presented. And so
it came about that in 1806 Robert Jones, Fellow of St John&rsquo;s, was
presented to the Church of Souldern.</p>

<p>Robert Jones&rsquo; claim to fame today is that he was a close friend of
William Wordsworth. They both entered St John&rsquo;s College, Cambridge,
Robert in June and William in October 1787. Jones was, like William, a
second son and destined for the church. They both shared a passion for
poetry, mountains and walking. William took only the subjects which
interested him while Robert had dropped to the third class by the end
of his first year.<sup>2</sup> Instead of studying during the summer
vacation of 1790, William and Robert decided on a walking tour of
Europe with the objective of reaching the Swiss Alps.<sup>3</sup></p>

<p>Many years later Wordsworth wrote &lsquo;In the month of August 1790 I
set off for the continent, in companionship with Robert Jones, a
Welshman, a fellow-collegian. We went staff in hand without knapsacks,
and carrying each his needments tied up in a pocket handkerchief, with
about twenty pounds a piece in our pockets. For what seemed best to me
worth recording in this tour, see the Poem of my own Life [The Prelude
Book 6]&rsquo;.<sup>4</sup></p>

<p>Not even Wordsworth&rsquo;s sister Dorothy was told and later she wrote
&lsquo;had he acquainted me with his scheme before its execution I should have
looked upon it mad and impracticable.&rsquo;<sup>5</sup></p>

<p>Despite Wordsworth&rsquo;s recollection of leaving for the continent in
August, records, and indeed a letter of his own written in 1790, show
that they spent the night of 12 July at Dover and the next day crossed
to France arriving at Calais on the eve of the celebrations of the 14
July;<sup>6</sup> this eventful day made little impression on the two
young men as all their thoughts were of poetry, nature and their
walking tour.<sup>7</sup> Between July and late September 1790 the two
undergraduates travelled nearly three thousand miles, walking at least
two thousand of them at a rate of more than thirty a day. From Calais
they walked almost due south to Chalon-sur-Sa√¥ne, &lsquo;a march it was of
military speed&rsquo;<sup>8</sup> where they hired a boat to travel down the
Rhine to a little below Lyon. Then they trekked across country
visiting the Grande Chartreuse, Geneva and the Lakes, passing through
the Simplon Pass and reaching Lake Maggiore, Lake Como and on through
North Italy, then to Basel where they bought about and sold it again
on reaching Cologne. From there they went on fool through Belgium and
finally home.<sup>9</sup></p>

<p>From Kesswil, Switzerland, Wordsworth tells Dorothy &lsquo;we have
several times performed a journey of thirteen leagues (40 miles) over
the most mountainous parts of Swisserland.&rsquo;<sup>10</sup></p>

 <p>They lived frugally and travelled light, and thirty years later
Robert recalls &lsquo;We were early risers in 1790 and generally walker 12
or 15 miles before breakfast and after feasting on the morning
Landscape how we afterwards feasted on our Dejeuner of whatever the
house might afford&rsquo;.<sup>11</sup>. The whole escapade was a remarkable
achievement showing great courage and stamina, both physical and
mental and it made a very strong bond between the pair.</p>

<p>Twenty-five years later Jones declared to Wordsworth &lsquo;I can assure
you that a Day seldom passes that I do not think of you will feelings
of inexpressibile affection&rsquo;.<sup>12</sup> Wordsworth, who had, with great feeling
dedicated his work, <i>Descriptive Sketches</i> (which recounted their memorable
tour), to Robert,<sup>13</sup> was equally fond of him; their friendship was to
endure until Robert&rsquo;s death in 1835.</p>

<p>By the middle of October they were both back at Cambridge, with
only a few short months left to prepare for their degree
examination.</p>

<p>In January 1791 one hundred and forty undergraduates were examined:
William and Robert being among those unplaced in order of
merit.<sup>14</sup> William did not want to go into the church: Jones
secured one of the Welsh fellowships offered by St John&rsquo;s and was able
to return to his wealthy home in Denbighshire. He obtained his M.A. in
the same year and his B.D. in 1791 and was ordained at the age of
twenty-three.<sup>15</sup></p>

<p>By the middle of May 1791 William, wearying of London and short of
money, decided to visit his friend Robert at Robert&rsquo;s family home,
Plas-yn-Llan, at Llangynhafal, Denbighshire.<sup>16</sup> The Jones&rsquo;
lived in the house by the church in a glorious situation high on the
Clwydian range of mountains.<sup>17</sup> According to one description
Jones&rsquo; home was rambling Tudor house with a courtyard. The most
impressive house in the neighbourhood beautifully
situated,<sup>18</sup> although Wordsworth, according to Dorothy
called it &lsquo;quite a cottage just such a one would suit us&rsquo; and she adds &lsquo;and
oh! how sweetly situated in the most delicious of all Vales, the Vale of
Clwyd!&rsquo;<sup>19</sup></p>

<p>On 26 June 1791 Dorothy Wordsworth wrote to her close friend Jane Pollard:</p>

<p>I often hear from my brother William who is now in Wales where I think
he seems so happy that it is probable he will remain there all summer, or
a great part of it; who would not be happy enjoying the company of
three young ladies in the Vale of Clewyd and without rival? His friend
Jones is a charming young man and has FIVE SISTERS, three of whom are
at home at present, then there are mountains, rivers, woods and rocks,
whose charms without any other inducement would be sufficient to tempt
William to continue amongst as long as possible.&rsquo;<sup>20</sup></p>

A. G.. Hill (Oxford, 1985), 168 for the complete letter.</p>
</div>

<p>While enjoying the summer the two young men explored North Wales,
met the noted travel writer Thomas Pennant and stirred by Pennant&rsquo;s
description of an ascent of Snowdon decided to climb it at night in
order to see the sun rise from its peak.<sup>21</sup> Wordsworth gives a vivid
description of this climb in Book 14 of the Prelude balancing it with
the &lsquo;Crossing of the Alps&rsquo; in Book 6.<sup>22</sup></p>

<p>In 1792 William was once again in France walking extensively along
the banks of the Loire and he invited Robert to join him at
Blois. Robert, however, decided to take up a teaching post at Bangor
which would keep him in Wales until Christmas.<sup>23</sup></p>

</div>

<p>In 1793 an old school friend of William wanted to make a tour of
the west of England and Wales and invited William to accompany him
offering to pay his travelling expenses. Wordsworth was delighted to do
so. Unfortunately when they were approaching Salisbury they had an
accident in which their light gig was smashed beyond repair. His friend
Calvert decided to ride back home but William continued on foot
alone. On reaching Wales he travelled north and by the 30 August arrived
at Jones&rsquo; home where, Dorothy notes in a letter to her friend Jane &lsquo;he
is now quietly sitting down in the Vale of Clwyd...and passes his time
as happily as he could desire with his Friend Jones the companion of
his continental Tour&rsquo;.<sup>24</sup></p>

<p>Robert frequently visited the Wordsworths both at Grasmere and
later at Rydal Mount: in both places Robert would have met many of the
Wordsworth&rsquo;s illustrious friends, among them Sir Walter Scott and
William Coleridge. In September of 1800 Jones visited Grasmere on the
13th and then again a few days later. Jones returned again on the
Friday 19th September. Jones stayed with us until Friday 26th September.
Coleridge came on Tuesday 23rd and went home with Jones&rsquo;.<sup>25</sup></p>

<p>Blomfield mistakenly suggests that Robert went abroad again with
Wordsworth in 1802.<sup>26</sup> But Blomfield had based his supposition on the
sonnet Wordsworth wrote on that occasion which, though addressed to
Jones, was referring not to Wordsworth&rsquo;s current journey from Calais to
Ardres but to that other one in 1790.</p>

<blockquote>
 Jones, as from Calais southwards you and I<br/>
 Went pacing side by side this public way.<br/>
 Streamed with the pomp of a too credulous day.<br/>
 When faith was pledged to new-born liberty.<sup>27</sup>
</blockquote>

<p>Wordsworth is referring of course to Bastille Day, July, 1790.</p>

<p>Such was the young man, athletic, intelligent and charming who was
appointed to St Mary&rsquo;s Souldern in December 1806. He continued however
to live at his home, Plas-yn-Llan but set things in motion to improve
the money payment in lieu of tithes which, based in the 17th century
on the then prevailing price of corn, was now worth very little. In a
letter to St John&rsquo;s, Cambridge he writes:</p>

<p>&lsquo;at the beginning of my Incumbency I set aside an old composition
which was paid and acquiesced in by my more immediate predecessor
M. Horseman and all his predecessors for the last 13O years. The old
composition for tithes amounted to ¬£122 and their present value is
considerably more than ¬£300 per annum besides the Glebe which consists
of about 135 acres&rsquo;.<sup>28</sup></p>

<div class="footnote">
<p><sup>28</sup> DB 92.</p>
</div>

<p>A paper of c. 1800 compiled by Mr. Bond, St John&rsquo;s Bursar states &lsquo;In
Soulderne Parish there are 5 acres of enclosed glebe arable and about
4 acres pasture, with orchard, two kitchen gardens and Churchyard. In
all about 11 acres contiguous to the House.&rsquo;<sup>29</sup></p>

<div class="footnote">
<p><sup>29</sup> DB 93.</p>
</div>

<p>In March 1807 Robert Jones wrote to Bishop Charles Moss this living
has for a long time laboured under the disadvantage of a fixed money
payment by no means adequate to the present value of the Tithes which
hath been quietly used in by former Rectors.&rsquo;<sup>30</sup></p>

</div>

<p>In fact Mr. Horseman&rsquo;s son had stated that &lsquo;My Father always supposed
that the decree in Chancery might be set aside, but was deterred from
making the attempt by the fear of the expense and consequent ill will
of the parishioners. For his forbearance he never received any
compliment or compensation. His notion was that the living might be
doubled&rsquo;<sup>31</sup></p>

<div class="footnote">
<p><sup>31</sup> DB 94.</p>
</div>

<p>This &lsquo;notion&rsquo; was correct: Mr. Bond reported that the value of the
living in c. 1800 Was ¬£195 and with Taxes and Tenths deducted was ¬£170,
but that in his opinion &lsquo;if the 1,270 acres of land divided between
arable and grass were properly tithed, at say 6s. an acre for arable
and 4s. an acre for grass, then the net value would be ¬£385 15s. 0d.&rsquo;<sup class="added2018">32</sup></p>

<p>William Wing wrote of Horseman. &lsquo;This noted and quaint character, while
he fought successfully the battles of his clerical brethren against
the rapacity of lay landowners and impropriators, so neglected his own
privileges as Rector of Souldern, that his immediate successor raised
the value of his incumbency at least ¬£200 per annum by simply looking
after his just revenues.&rsquo;<sup>33</sup></p>

<hr id="p77"/>

<p>In the letter of March 1807 already mentioned Robert asks for a
certificate of nonresidence on the grounds that the buildings were
dilapidated and because of incipient fears of hostility from his
parishioners over his attempt to improve the rate of payment in lieu
ol tithes</p>

<p>He wrote again on 17 March from Wales stating that his curate Sir
William Clerke was looking after the Parish, and that he had not yet
signed the Bill for the ending of the Parish of Fritwell &lsquo;but that the
enclosure should be highly advantageous to the Living of Souldern&rsquo;<sup>34</sup></p>

<div class="footnote">
 <p><sup>34</sup> OD c. 658 2.</p>
</div>

<p>By April he had gone to Cambridge to consult with the Master and
Senior Fellows about selling some property in Fritwell in order to
redeem the land tax on the Rectory of Souldern.<sup>35</sup></p>

<div class="footnote">
 <p><sup>35</sup> OD c. 658 3.</p>
</div>

<p>It is not clear whether Robert received a certificate of
non-residence or not but he continued to live in Wales occasionally
visiting Cambridge. Writing again from Cambridge in May 1807 he stated
that his glebe consisted of 11 acres in Souldern and about 60 statute
acres in the open fields of Fritwell, of which he proposed selling
about 8 acres near the village of Fritwell along with the cottage and
garden in the same parish. He reckoned on getting ¬£30 per acre,
sufficient to redeem the land tax in both parishes:</p>

<p>&lsquo;my allotment in Fritwell if the Enclosure Bill has passed will be
within a quarter of a mile of the house and home stall at Souldern and
only separated from the Souldern part of the Glebe by the Turnpike
road from Bicester to Anho; nor will any new Building be necessary in
consequence of the Enclosure.<sup>36</sup></p>

<div class="footnote">
 <p><sup>36</sup> OD c. 658 4.</p>
</div>

<p>Between March 1807 and January of the following year there was a
constant exchange of letters between the Bishop and Robert, the latter
continuing his plea for a certificate of nonresidence, chiefly on the
grounds that the house was not fit for habitation. There had been in
the early 19th century an increase of legislative activity concerning
clerical residence<sup>37</sup> so it was not surprising that by
October 1807 Bishop Charles&rsquo; patience was wearing very thin. He
asked Robert to explain his continued non-residency: The rough draft
of his letter begins, &lsquo;Sir, I am not a little surprised at the
tenor of your letter and particularly after the Indulgence I have
shown you&rsquo; and went on to point out that the house had been
inhabited by his predecessor until the day of his death. He went on to
ask that if repairs were needed why had they not been done that
summer. He continues &lsquo;I might have deferred summoning you to residence
for a few weeks until you had been a twelve month in possession of
your preferment had it not been for an injunction which I had lately
received from the Privy Council&rsquo;. He ends by saying that he would have
to bring the provisions of the Residence Act against him if he did not
immediately take up residence in Souldern, and in a postscript to his
secretary lets his annoyance towards Robert show by adding &;squo;(I
would omit the mention of authority because, if he does not know it
already, he will soon find out)&rsquo;<sup>38</sup></p>

 <p><sup>38</sup> OD c. 658 56.</p>
</div>

<p>Robert&rsquo;s reply was curt. He was engaged in a Curacy in the
neighbourhood of his home. Sir William Clerke took very good care of
the church at Souldern; the house was no fit habitation for a clergy
man and that he meant to do something about it the following summer
and would set out for Souldern the following day&rsquo;.<sup>39</sup></p>

<p>Mr. Bond in his report to Cambridge had said nothing about the
house being uninhabitable, just that &ldquo;The house is of stone, rough as
to workmanship, old and rather lange, the ground rooms awkwardly
disposed&rdquo;.<sup>40</sup></p>

<div class="footnote">
 <p><sup>40</sup> DB 94.</p>

<p>Robert&rsquo;s letter in November (from Souldern) ends on an arrogant
note: &lsquo;it is perhaps unnecessary for me to add that by quitting my
usual Place of Residence for this place immediately after the Receipt
of your Lordship&rsquo;s letter of the 24th of last month and complying with
your wishes which I am not more [&lsquo;less&rsquo; crossed out] in duty bound than
by Inclination disposed to do I am so far from laying the Residence Act
in force against me that I am saving you that trouble.&rsquo;<sup>41</sup></p>

<div class="footnote">

</div>

<p>According to a terrier of 1638 the dwelling house at that time was &lsquo;new
built, with two Barnes and a stable in good repair&rsquo;.</p>

<p>Blomfield fills in the details sying that the Pre-Reformation house
consisted of &lsquo;a hall in the centre with a soler at one end, and a
buttery, cellar and kitchen at the other. A small staircise with a
small projecting gable in the centre of the house, led out of the hall
into the upper apartments [and that] Mr. Harding, rector (1642&ndash;48) had
added to it on the south side the parsonage house referred to as
&ldquo;new-built.&rdquo;&rsquo;<sup>42</sup></p>

<div class="footnote">
 <p><sup>42</sup> DB 95.</p>
</div>

<p>The Churchwardens in their yearly returns from the late 18th century
and during Robert&rsquo;s tenancy always stated that the &lsquo;Church and
Parsonage House and outhouses thereto belonging are in good
repair&rsquo;. It was not until 1828 that they noted &lsquo;all well excepting the
Rectory House now under repair but nearly finished&rsquo;.<sup>43</sup></p>

<p>In January 1808 Robert invokes the Gilbert Act which allowed money
to be advanced or borrowed for the repair or rebuilding of premises
for the benefit of the clergy and once again asks for a Licence of
absence.<sup>44</sup> The Bishop cautiously replies hat he would be
delighted to enable him to raise the necessary money but that he must
first receive the proper papers and proof that the work had actually
begun. He makes the further proviso that Robert is to stay in the
neighbourhood either in Souldern itself or in a neighbouring parish,
adding as a parting shot. I see no reason for your removing to a
distance, and it certainly will be in your interest that the workmen
should be under your constant and immediate view and
attendance.<sup>45</sup></p>

</div>

<p>This reply in no way suited Robert who now wrote at length to ask
for a licence for non-residency until May 1809. He explained that he
could not properly fulfil his duties at Souldern while the repairs
were going on, that he really had to go to Wales to live with his
mother (one of the best of mothers who is far advanced in years) and
with his sisters, that he would be usefully employed as curate as
before. He repeats that no one could serve the parish of Souldern
better than his curate, Sir William Clerke, who was resident at
Fritwell and that since anyway the farmers were so incensed at the
recent enforcement of his rights regarding tithes that it would be
better if he stayed away until &lsquo;a little time and absence would
effectually heal&rsquo; their irritation. (He had forgotten that he had said
in an earlier letter that &lsquo;All the occupiers and proprietors of land
in the Parish have at last agreed not to resist my
claims<sup>46</sup>) He ends by laying out the value of the living;
the composition for tithes came to ¬£435; his gross income would then
be ¬£631 and after deductions for various taxes and interest and part
of the Principal of ¬£500 raised for repairs, he would have a net
income of ¬£500 a year.<sup>47</sup> The Bishop gave in and issued a
licence of absence until March 1809.<sup>48</sup></p>

<p>It would seem that the Bishop and Jones were at cross purposes; the
Parsonage (Fig. 1) was evidently adequate for living in but Jones was
perhaps thinking on the lines of Wordsworth&rsquo;s (and Coleridge&rsquo;s) view
that &lsquo;among the benefits from a Church establishment of endowments
corresponding with the wealth of the county to which it belongs, may
be reckoned as eminently important, the examples of civility and
refinement which the clergy ... afford to the whole people Wordsworth
adds that the established clergy were the principal bulwark against
barbarism.&rsquo;</p>

<p>He continues with a description of his ideal, a parsonage house
generally stands not far from the church this proximity imposes
favourable restraints, and sometimes suggests an affecting union of
the accommodations and elegancies of life with outward signs of piety
and mortality&rsquo;.</p>

<p>He added: &ldquo;The precincts of an old residence must be treated
by ecclesiastics with respect both from prudence and
necessity&rsquo;.<sup>49</sup> Possibly influenced by this view Robert
proceeded to spend the money raised by improving the south front
rather than making interior changes.<sup>50</sup> The terrier of 1811
describes the house as slated, with a dairy adjoining and two thatched
stables and a pleasure ground in front of the house. A barn of two
bays and a Cowhouse, both thatcher, were built by Jones in 1810 as
were tanslated necessaries and a stone walled garden for fruit trees
on the north, extending from the north-east to the northwest, which
with an already existing orchard and nursery for trees comprised two
acres of land; furthermore there also existed the daily round paddock
a spinney and an established pond all together extending over more
than three acres.</p>

<p>Earlier in 1808 in Frtwell Jones had built a slated Barn of five Bays
with a slated stable adjoining it; between 1808 and 1809 he had had
extensive quickset hedges set up in the glebe at Fitwell. In 1810 he
built two thatched hovels and walled with stone both the farmyard and
the Stackyard.<sup>51</sup></p>

<p>How much all this cost is not known; the original amount horrowed
was ¬£662 6s. 10d.<sup>52</sup> a strangely precise amount; later Jones was to
explain his mounting debts on these improvements.</p>

<p>Presumably Jones took up residence in March 1809 when his licence
for absence expired, but the first sign that he was actually living in
Souldern was in 1810 when he attended a Vestry meeting for the first
time;<sup>53</sup> for the next thirteen years according to his own
statement he remained in Souldern.<sup>54</sup></p>

<p>In July 1820 Wordsworth and a group of friends decided to re-trace
the steps of his earlier tour across France and Switzerland. On their
journey to Dover they visited Souldern where they found their once
athletic friend grown soft and very fat, no longer fit for a walking
tour even if he had been free to go while they were in Souldern news
that Robert&rsquo;s mother had died reached them and leaving his friends
Robert hastened to Plas-yn-Llan.<sup>55</sup></p>

<div class="footnote">

<p>Wordsworth was impressed by Robert&rsquo;s dwelling which so
dcosely exemplified his own views on how a parsonage should look, and
while there composed a sonnet entitled <i>A Parsonage in
Oxfordshire</i> in which he comments in a philosophical manner on the
absence of a dividing wall or boundary between the churchyard (Fig. 2)
and his friend&rsquo;s garden.<sup>56</sup> In later years he recalled
the visit: &lsquo;With pleasure I recall... the residence of an old
and much-valued friend in Oxfordshire. The house and church stand
parallel to each other, at a small distance a circular lawn or rather
grass-plot spreads between them; shrubs and trees curve from each side
of the dwelling, veiling, but not hiding, the church. From the front
of this dwelling, no part of the burial-ground is seen, but as you
wind by the side of the shrubs towards the steeple-end of the church,
the eye catches a single, small low, monumental headstone, moss-grown,
sinking into and gently inclining towards the earth. Advance, and the
churchyard, populous and with glittering tombstones, opens up on the
view.&rsquo;<sup>57</sup> This visit in 1820 was the only time that
Wordsworth came to Souldern, all other meetings between the two
friends took place elsewhere.</p>

<p>In 1816 Edmund Legge succeeded Bishop Charles as Bishop of Oxford
in June 1822 Robert wrote a rather frantic letter to him concerning
his fears of his own imminent arrest for debt.<sup>58</sup> It is
clear from this letter that Robert had been living well beyond his
means. He put down his money difficulties to debts incurred in
repairing the rectory which he had estimated at ¬£500.<sup>59</sup> He
had however also erected several buildings and walls of stone in
Fritwell in spite of his assertion in his letter of May 1807, &lsquo;nor
will any new Buildings be necessary in consequence of the
Inclosure&rsquo;.<sup>60</sup></p>

<p>When in 1808 he had been granted permission to raise the necessary
money he had considered a little over ¬£600 to be sufficient. An
indenture had been drawn up between him and Henry Churchill of
Deddington for a loan to Robert of ¬£662 6s.10d. to be repaid at a rate of
¬£5 10s. 0d. per centum if Robert continued to reside in Souldern or ¬£10 0s. 0d.
per centum if he did not.<sup>61</sup> He had had 13 years to repay
and according to him a gross income of ¬£500,<sup>62</sup> though in an
earlier letter he had put his income at ¬£613 gross and ¬£500
net<sup>63</sup>) His debts now mounted to over ¬£3,000<sup>64</sup> an
enormous sum even if he had underestimated the cost of all his
rebuilding.</p>

<p>His letter to Bishop Lesse written in the third person mentions
that &lsquo;some of his creditors have had recourse to legal measures and
your Petitioner hath just cause to fear that his Person will very
shortly be arrested and lodged in one of his Majesty&rsquo;s Prisons whereby
the Parishioners will be deprived of their Minister.&rsquo; The Bishop
realised that he had to accept Robert Jones&rsquo; suggestion that the
Reverend Francis Clerke, fellow of All Souls, should act as curate in
Souldern for a stipend of ¬£55 0s. 0d. with the surplice fees and use
of the Rectory house, garden and office, with a further allowance of
¬£6 10s. 0d. towards payment of taxes, and allowed Robert leave of
absence until December 1823.<sup>65</sup> In fact Robert never
returned to Souldern and Francis Clerke continued to look after the
parish until 1826 when he was succeeded by another fellow of All
Soul&rsquo;s College, J.A. Walpole, followed by W. Cotton Risley fellow of
New College, whose stipend was raised to ¬£700 0s. 0d.<sup>66</sup></p>

<p>There are two documents extant for February 1825: the first is a
writ of <i>fieri facias de bonis ecclesiasticis</i> by which the creditor of a
Church of England incumbent could obtain payment out of the profits of
the incumbent&rsquo;s benefice when he had no assets of his own. One of
Jones creditors must have been Lambert Molony of Boulogne-sur-Mer,
France, because it seems that he obtained a judgement in court against
Robert Jones. Having obtained judgement, a writ to the Sheriff of
Oxford against Jones&rsquo; goods would have followed. The Sheriff would
then have made the return that Jones had no goods or chattels out of
which the debt could be satisfied, but that Jones was the incumbent of
the benefice of Souldern.<sup>67</sup></p>

</div>

<p>Next a writ was issued against the Bishop of Oxford for Jones&rsquo;
debt to be paid from the benefice of Souldern. The Bishop then 
issued a warrant of sequestration to a named sequestrator, in this case 
Lambert Molony. Next this warrant was affixed on or near the
church door in Souldern. The Bishop remained personally
responsible for the execution of the writ and the warrant of
sequestration was merely his direction to his agent (Molony) to do
what the court had ordered him to do. The second document extant is a
bond given by Molony to the Bishop as security for the obligations he
will have assumed as sequestrator Lambert Molony was bound to provide
out of the profits of the benefice for all outings of the Rectory as
well as for the performance of divine service. Once all debts were
discharged Molony would have been released from his bond.<sup>68</sup></p>

<p>By June 1822 Robert had become an absentee Rector and had settled
comfortably in Wales. Evidently his &lsquo;inconsiderable landed property&rsquo;
being entailed<sup>69</sup> was safe from the creditors he had left behind.</p>

<p>Robert had long been pressing the Wordsworths to visit him in Wales
and now in the summer of 1824 they were at last free to do so. On 24
August they set out from Rydal Mount and eventually reached Llanrwst
in the Vale of Conway where they had arranged to meet Robert. They
were delighted to see him again, and as he had brought his carriage
and a servant it not only made travelling more comfortable but they
moved at a lesurely pace which suited everybody. Jones came into his
own with his knowledge of Welsh and his good temper soothed William&rsquo;s
irritibility which surfaced when travelling: altogether he was the best
tempered Creature imaginable.<sup>70</sup> Jones introduced them to his friends
in the Vale of Clwyd and to the famous &lsquo;Ladies of Llangollen&rsquo;, Lady
Eleanor Butler and the Hon. Sarah Ponsonby. They retraced William and
Robert&rsquo;s earlier steps across Snowdonia, revisited Beddgelert, from
whence the two had made their midnight ascent of Snowdon thirty-three
years earlier, finally parting after thirteen days journeying at
Devil&rsquo;s Bridge.<sup>71</sup></p>

<p>Robert still managed to get into financial difficulties, in 1825
Dorothy Wordsworth had the unpleasant duty of writing to Robert about a
sum of money owed to her brother, though she softened the request, by
implicitly inviting him to Rydal Mount again.</p>


<hr id="p83"/>

<p>&lsquo;Did you or did you not remit to Masterman and Co. the little
sum (I believe about ¬£8 0s. 0d.) which you owed my brother ... I tell
him,&rsquo; she wrote diplomatically, that you have intended coming
this summer, and settling all in such a much pleasanter and more
convenient way than through the medium of Bankers &ndash; yourself by
the fireside at Rydal Mount.... Will you trust yourself again to my
guidance to the Top of one of our Mountains? Or did I give you too
much of it last time?&rsquo;<sup>72</sup></p>

<p>A letter from Dorothy in October 1825 speaks of Robert&rsquo;s
liking for quiet enjoyment rather than bustling pleasures and calls
Glyn Marvin where he had a curacy the &lsquo;Valley of
Meditation&rsquo;.<sup>73</sup> Already in 1824 Wordsworth had noted
his friend&rsquo;s plumpness, ruddy cheeks and smiling
countenance&rsquo; and that he seemed to those who met him
&lsquo;little suited to a hermit living in the Vale of
Meditation&rsquo;.<sup>74</sup></p>

<p>In May 1826 Wordsworth regretted that he had no hope of visiting
Wales that year as they had had notice to quit Rydal Mount (which did
not in the event happen) but he begs his friend to come and see us, we
are growing old and ought to make the best of our time to keep up long
tried affection.<sup>75</sup> Sara Hutchinson wrote in September of that year from
Rydal Mount &lsquo;we are threatened with a visit from Mr Coleridge, and
have had a letter proposing a visit from William&rsquo;s Welsh friend
Mr. Jones.&rsquo;<sup>76</sup></p>

<p>By 1832 when Jones once again visited the Wordsworths at Rydal
Mount Dorothy paints picture of him &lsquo;fat and roundabout and
rosy, and pulling and panting while he climbs the little hill from the
road to our house&rsquo;.<sup>77</sup> This along with a letter of
Dorothy&rsquo;s written to him in October 1825 where she says
&lsquo;we really were not sorry that you did not arrive in the course
of last summer for you would have had no quiet enjoyment and you are
not made for bustling pleasures&rsquo; gives a picture of a person
grown indolent, out of condition and inclined to introspection, far
different from the vigorous athletic person always ready for a walking
tour in the company of his close friend.<sup>78</sup></p>

<p>Robert was still in name Rector of Souldern; licences for
non-residence subsequent to the one issued for June 1822 to December
1823 are either not extant or were never issued; however licences do
exist spanning the years from March 1831 to 1836, the last issued in
March 1835 just a month before Robert&rsquo;s death.<sup>79</sup> It would
seem that he lived more or less permanently in Wales leaving the care
of the parish to others.</p>

<p>Robert Jones died in April 1835 at Plas-yn-Llan; a notice appeared
in the june issue of the Gentleman&rsquo;s Magazine to that
effect.<sup>80</sup> Memorials to some of the Rectors of Souldern are
in be found in the church but no sign of affection or memorial
followed Robert&rsquo;s death. Wordsworth wrote of their friendship &lsquo;Much of
the latter part of his life he passed in comparative solitude, which I
know was often cheered by remembrance of our youthful adventures, and
of the beautiful regions which at home and abroad we had visit
toogether. Our long friendship was never subject to a moments
interruption, and while revising these volumes for the last time, I
have been so often reminded of my loss with a not unpleasing sadness
that I trust the reader will excuse mention of a man who well deserves
me something more than so brief a notice.&rsquo;<sup>81</sup></p>

<p>Wordsworth, who felt things deeply, was still moved to tears two
years later while at Lake Como in 1837. &lsquo;At lake Como memories
of Robert Jones&rsquo; (and of Mary and Dorothy on the 1820 tour)
&lsquo;came upon him as fresh as if they had happened the day
before&rsquo; wrote Dora and that William had confessed to her
&lsquo;I kept to myself and very often could for my heart&rsquo;s
relief have burst into tears.<sup>82</sup></p>

<p>As early as 1820 Wordsworth had summed up this complex friend in
his poem</p>

<blockquote>
 <p>A Character<sup>83</sup></p>

<p>I marvel how Nature could ever find space<br/>
For so many strange contrasts in one human face<br/>
There&rsquo;s throught, and no thought, there&rsquo;s paleness and bloom<br/>
And bustle and sluggishness, pleasure and gloom.</p>

<p>There&rsquo;s weakness and strength both redundant and vain<br/>
Such strength as if ever affliction and pain<br/>
Could pierce through a temper that&rsquo;s soft to disease.<br/>
Would be rational peace &ndash; a philosopher&rsquo;s ease.</p>

<p>There&rsquo;s indifference, alike when he fails or succeeds,<br/>
And attention full ten times as much as there needs;<br/>
Pride where there&rsquo;s no envy, there&rsquo;s so much of joy;<br/>
And mildness, and spirit both forward and coy.</p>

<p>There&rsquo;s freedom, and sometimes a diffident stare<br/>
Of shame scarcely seeming to know that she&rsquo;s there.<br/>
There&rsquo;s virtue, the title it surely can claim,<br/>
Yet wants heaven knows what to be worthy the name.</p>

<p>This picture from Nature may seem to depart,<br/>
Yet the man would at once run away from your heart;<br/>
And I for five centuries right guy wuld be<br/>
Such an odd, such a kind happy creature, as he.</p>
