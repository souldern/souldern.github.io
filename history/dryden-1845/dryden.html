 <h3>A SHORT ACCOUNT OF THE</h3>
 <h2>PARISH OF SOULDERN,</h2>
 <h3>OXFORDSHIRE.</h3>

<p>
SOULDERN, anciently called Sulthorn, is a parish in the Hundred of
Ploughley, Deanery and Union of Bicester, Diocese and County of
Oxford; it is five miles north-east of Steeple Aston. The living is a
rectory, rated at £8 14s. 2d., gross income £480. The tithes were
commuted in 1839, the aggregate amount £418 3s. Od. The present
patrons are the Master and Fellows of St. John's College,
Cambridge. There are a day and Sunday School endowed with £6 per
annum. Poor-rates in 1838, £157 14s. Od. Acres 2270. Houses
116. Assessed property £2877. Population in 1801, 394—in 1831, 599<sup>a</sup>.
</p>

<p>The Church is dedicated to St. Mary. The early Norman Tower
remains, having walls of great thickness, but it inclines far from the
perpendicular: the Nave has a Clerestory, and is parted from the
South Aisle by three pointed arches resting on round colums; the nave
and aisle retain some ancient carved seats. Some of the windows of the
aisle are elaborate and curious specimens of early Decorated work. The
Porch, and the aisle to which it opens, have each a pointed arched
doorway, without capitals to the jambs, the labels terminate in
heads. The Chancel is modern and bad<sup>b</sup>. It was rebuilt in the time of
the last Rector but one, a clergyman of more celebrity as a
Commissioner of Inclosure Acts than in his own profession. In 1184,
Hugh Bishop of Lincoln, confirmed a grant of this Church made by
Jordan de Sai
to Ensham Abbey<sup>c</sup>; the Bishop reserved a pension of two marks of silver
to the monks from the revenues of the Church<sup>d</sup>. In the reign of Henry
III., Robert de Hay, Rector of Sulthorn, claimed from the Abbot and
Convent of Oseney, a certain measure of corn for their demesne at
Mixbury, and fourpence yearly for their demesne of Fulwell, by virtue
of an old custom called “Chirch&shy;scete,” and agreed, with the consent of
the patrons, to receive a yearly pension of five shillings in full
satisfaction for the said corn and money<sup>e</sup>. There was a hide of land at
Fritwell<sup>f</sup>, called Sulthorn hide, the tithes of which were claimed by
the Rector of Sulthorn; a controversy arising, the Canons [of
St. Frideswide, I presume,] appealed to Pope Gregory the Ninth<sup>g</sup>, who
delegated the trial to the Priors of St. John and St. James, and the
Dean of Northampton; they gave it in favor of the Canons, but the
controversy was tried three several times, and at last it was agreed
that the Rector of Sulthorn should have the tithes of the said hide of
land, but pay two shillings a year to the Priory. This dispute led to
the excommunication of Stephen, parson of Fritwell, by sentence of the
Pope, whose submission, after two years, was testified by the Prior of
Brackley and the Rector of Aynho. About 1270, Philip Basset sold the
Manor of Sulthorn to Ralph Bray for forty marks of silver<sup>h</sup>. In 1277,
Ensham Abbey had a yearly pension of one hundred shillings from this
living<sup>i</sup>. In 1305 a trial took place in the Court of King's Bench as to
the right of patronage of this Church, between Thomas Abbot of Ensham,
and Lucy widow of Thomas de Leuknore and Peter de Schevyndon, the
living being then vacant by the death of John de Bernewell, The Abbey
gained the cause with ten marks damages<sup>j</sup>.</p>

Souldern, Esquire.</p>

<h3>SEPULCHRAL REMAINS FOUND AT SOULDERN.</h3>

<p>
In Mr. Beesley's “History of Banbury,” p. 36-38, is an account of the
line of the Portway in the vicinity of Souldern, and mention made of
skeletons discovered in Aynho Park, which lies close on the north side
of the brook which divides the two parishes, and reaches to within
about half a mile of Souldern village. Antiquaries are not agreed as
to the extent and exact line of the Portway, but its average course is
probably about north and south, and it certainly passed close to Aynho
and Souldern. South Northamptonshire and the adjoining part of
Oxfordshire was cultivated in very early times, and in consequence
there are very few visible remains of the Britons or Romans, but
numerous remains of those nations have been at different times
discovered by the spade in this district.
</p>

<p>In January, 1844, having heard that remains had been recently
discovered at Souldern, I visited the spot, which is a garden on the
west side of the narrow road, leading out of the main street of
Souldern, down the hill, southward. The ground falls from the garden
on all sides but the west. A skeleton and urn (A) were discovered by
workmen who were digging stone, from whose infor&shy;mation and a compass
I made out their relative position. The soil was about two feet thick
on a deep rock of limestone. The skeleton was of man's stature;
judging by the teeth about thirty or thirty-five years of age,
stretched out at full length on its back, W. by S. and E. by N., head
to the former. The rock was hollowed out to receive it, the bones
being three feet under the surface. On its right hand side of its head
lay a pair of bone ornaments two inches long, in shape four
sided-cones, having on
each side nine small engraved circles. At the small end of each is
inserted an iron rivet, which is probably the remains of a hook for
suspension, perhaps from the ear, by another brass ring. About the
head were many fragments of thin brass,<sup>*</sup> which when collected and put
together form parts of two bands, the first of which is seven inches
long and three-fourths wide, and has encircled the lower part of a
leathern skull cap. The edges of the leather and of this brass band
were held together by a thin concave brass binding, in the hollow of
which fragments of leather are still to be seen. On each side of the
helmet, attached to the brass band, was an ornamental hinge for a chin
strap.</p>

<p>Of the other band about one foot five inches are existing, the
whole of which is of equal width and one-eighth narrower than the
first. It was probably the binding of the edge of the helmet where
there would be a seam, or intended to encircle the helmet close above
the other binding. On both these bands are rivets, which shew that the
leather rivetted was three-sixteenths thick. Nothing else, according
to my informants, was found with the skeleton. About seven feet north
of its head was found an urn (A) containing bones; about the same
depth under the surface as the skeleton. The urn was in fragments when
discovered but has since been restored. It is of rather coarse black
pottery, averaging about three sixteenths of an inch in thickness, and
imperfect in the lip. What remains is seven and three quarters inches
high and eight and three quarters inches in diameter. It is ornamented
on the upper part by two horizontal bands of dancetted pattern. At
about twothirds up the sides are four roundish projections at equal
distances from each other and between them semicircular bands of
ornament.</p>

<p>About five feet E. by S. from the urn and eleven feet from the head
of the skeleton, they found a number of bones in a heap, which they
thought had been moved before. These were probably the remainder of a
body or bodies, of which parts were inclosed in one or all of the
three urns.</p>
<div class="footnote"><sup>*</sup> One part tin to seven parts copper.  K</div>

<p>The workmen soon stopped digging, but some months
afterwards began again to get stone in the same garden, and found
about two
and a half feet below the surface two more urns (B,C). The first
contained fragments of bones. It is five and a half inches high and
eight and a half inches in the widest diameter; composed of light grey
pottery, and very thin, and great part being only oneeighth of an inch
thick. The ornamental work on it is very slight, (see plate) of which
the chief part is dancetted pattern, each triangle being filled with
from nine to thirteen small circular indentations.</p>


<p>The other urn (C) was imperfect in the upper part, and probably was
fractured when interred, for it contained the skull of an infant of a
few days old, which was too large to have been admitted through the
mouth of the urn. Many sepulchral urns have been discovered, evidently
fractured before interment, containing bones too large to have been
passed through the mouth; and occasionally the vessels have been
joined together again, after the insertion of the bones. This urn is
five and a half inches high (the lip being lost) and six and a half
inches in its widest diameter (see plate). It is of black pottery,
about a quarter of an inch thick, and destitute of ornament.</p>

<p>None of the urns were protected by stones or tiles from the
pressure of the earth.</p>

<p>About twenty-five feet W. by N. of the
skeleton was found a skeleton several years ago; and about 1840 “some
things” were found about thirty or forty feet N.E. of the skeleton. I
was unable to learn any further particulars of those discoveries.</p>

<p>The
skeletons discovered north of Aynho village lay N. and S., but we are
not informed to which point the heads were laid.<sup>*</sup> Most of the
skeletons found in these parts, accompanied by pottery of this class,
have had the heads between S. and W. From the pottery found at
Souldern, I am inclined to attribute these remains to the Romanized
Britons of the fifth or sixth century, but in the opinion of some
antiquaries they belong to the Saxons of the eighth century.</p>

<p>The
three urns, brass straps, and one of the two bone ornaments, are now in
my possession; having been given to me by the Rev. Dr. Stephenson and
others.</p>
