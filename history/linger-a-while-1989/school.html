<h2 id="TOC-SCHOOL">SCHOOL</h2>

<p>Every morning in school our schoolmaster, John Wills, nicknamed
Jimmy, gave his pet girls gob stoppers (sweets). He&rsquo;d walk round
during lessons and put a gob stopper in their mouth as they were busy
writing. Very rare would the boys get one. Sometimes after he&rsquo;d been
through the classroom, forty odd of us, picking his pets, he may have
one or two over. Perhaps some girls would be absent through illness or
something. He would try to give us one. No way, we weren&rsquo;t having his
leftovers, so we refused. But his favourite trick as you were bent
over doing your work, was he would reach over from behind and push a
gob stopper in your mouth. We boys set our teeth and shook our
heads.</p>

<p>One day I had a cold. Much to the amusement of the other boys Jimmy
tried to push a gob stopper in my mouth. &ldquo;Oh you have a cold!&rdquo; he
said, wringing his snot-sticky hands. We boys were tough, and no way
would we have anything that girls had.</p>

<p>We grew up hard, men before we were boys hardly. Our
fathers took us to work &ndash; garden or on the farms. Over sixty men
were working on farms, gardens or linked to the land, so children
after school helped in some measure.</p>

<p>On one occasion I did well in the school exams. Top of the school
at eleven years old. Jimmy did me well: Sixpence (6d &ndash; 2 and a half
pence) was my reward, plus a tennis ball. The sixpence was out of his
pocket.  A king&rsquo;s ransom for me.</p>

<p>The ball was given to the school for collecting
eggs and money from parents, farmers, shop or business people,
for the Doctor Barnardo children: Dozens and dozens of eggs we
brought to school and money. We tramped around the roads and
lanes, miles, for a week, every spare moment &ndash; visiting all and
everyone, even the tight-fisted and miserable. We knew them so
we took it in turns. &ldquo;I went last year, your turn this year!&rdquo; We
went and wheedled the pennies, perhaps a couple of eggs. No
matter how small or large we took pride in the fact that all gave
something. When we finished there was some three or four pounds in money.
Possibly twenty odd dozen eggs (whole ones) for our cause. A few
were broken by small children opening gates and climbing stiles
on the way to school with their eggs.</p>

<p>
A real Belcher would tell you a tall story, or a fib, looking you
straight in the eye, without blinking, or smiling. They would
unwind a real corker. Offtimes others would extend it:</p>

<p>Bill got a nanny goat from a local farmer, which he put in his
council house garden.</p>

<p>&ldquo;My,&rdquo; said a neighbour, &ldquo;She&rsquo;s got a lot of milk!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Bill, &ldquo;I milk two gallons a day from her. Course the
kids &rsquo;as all the milk they want from her as well.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do they?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh yes&rdquo; said Bill. &ldquo;Sometimes I &rsquo;as to milk a gallon or so out
last thing at night, &rsquo;cos of the hedgehogs suckling her!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do they now?&rdquo; said the neighbour.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes&rdquo; says Bill. &ldquo;I reckon she does six or seven
gallons a day altogether.&rdquo;</p>

<p>
Some heard of the goat and its big milk yield, so he got a milk
churn (13 gallon) put it by Bill&rsquo;s gate with a note on it:</p>

<p>&ldquo;To be called for daily.&rdquo; Someone else saw the milk lorry driver
collecting from the farms and sent him in the council estate to
collect the churn. The village laughed for weeks over that &ndash; such
story telling is known as &lsquo;razeling&rsquo;.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Please sir, shoes gone to be mended.&rdquo;</p>

<p>This was a regular absence with half the children who had only one
pair of boots &ndash; no slipper or welly or plimsole. Paper hankies were
unheard of &ndash; perhaps a bit of rag, but not always that what they
usually did was blow it onto the floor. Hence the riddle &ldquo;what is it
the rich man saves and puts in his pocket and the poor man throws
away?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Beware of a child with a cold if you&rsquo;re playing because their
sleeves would be filthy where they would backhand their nose like the
chap with a bad streaming cold being asked the way: He gave directions
with his hands, &ldquo;If you go up here and across there,&rdquo; each time the
back of his hands would brush under his nose &ldquo;and down there by our
Will&rsquo;s mother,&rdquo; the sleeve being brought down and under the nose to
give a final clean.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ole 4 eyes &ndash; 2 in front and 2 behind,&rdquo; this was a child with 2
great big patches on the backside of their trousers. Oft times they
were blue or brown on grey, no care was taken to match or blend the
patches tacked on with black cotton or thread some&shy;thing hard
wearing, as they would say, &ldquo;No matter about the colour as long as
they be clean and tidy like.&rdquo;</p>

<p>
Night and morning for 2 years Crackin Charlie walked 10 miles for
seasonal work. This was haymaking, harvesting, mangold cart and
thrashing. He was a happy worker especially thrashing. He liked
cutting the bonds of strings, around the sheaves of corn and feeding
them down into the concave of the thrasher. The hum of the drum as
it revolved, the slap of belt and buckle as they turned, the wheels
of straw shakers, the elevator rakes and chains clicking and the clanker,
the bark of the drum when a sheave went in wholesale or wet and not
parted very well by the feeder. He loved the noise of it all.</p>

<p>When he&rsquo;d had his 3 o&rsquo;clock break, Mum sent gallons of tea, chunks
of cake &ndash; homemade, then the last two hours he would sing every song
he knew. Other workers nodded towards him and smiled:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Crackin&rsquo;s in fine fettle today.&rdquo; Dad used to say:</p>

<p>&ldquo;That boy&rsquo;s worth an extra bob (a shilling or 5p) a day the way
they put their backs in it when he loosens up with &lsquo;I&rsquo;m forever
blowing bubbles&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The work was so much easier with Crackin brightening up the end of
a hard day. I believe he had some illness that left him in bad shape
that he did not do hard work again but he loved his days with us at
Chisnell and Bush Farm, Clifton Fields, Hazel Hedge Lane and
Deddington. <br>
