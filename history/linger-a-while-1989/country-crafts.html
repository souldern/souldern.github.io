<h2 id="TOC-COUNTRY-CRAFTS">COUNTRY CRAFTS</h2>

<p>The country crafts that have sadly changed or are falling in
abeyance on our farms are many and varied. Two country workmen I miss
most as I walk our country roads, lanes and footpaths are the thatcher
and the hedger. The thatcher as the roofs of buildings are covered in
other ways now but the hedger, I truly miss. Like most farm jobs it
was handed down from father to son or neighbour’s son, country folk
being helpful and willing to pass on to the youngsters their knowledge
and skills and even their tools. The hedger was always in his billy
hat, cord trousers, a hardwearing jacket or gerkin, leather apron,
strong leather boots, and thick heavy gloves. As a boy I would try to
put the stiff half clenched gloves on. No way could I move my hands
let alone clench axe, bill hook or slash hook as Ole Teddy did weeks
and months of the winter on our farm!</p>

<p>Jobs were done in rotation: the hedges every seven years were cut
and laid. The laying of the hedge meant a good many of the young
sapling growths that grew up from the stools, were cut out altogether
to be used to bind the top of the hedge around the stakes. The others
we would chop with bill hook half-way through, bend them down and lay
them down diagonally, to grow side shoots, strengthen the hedge in a
more or less weaving pattern. So the whole thing welds together into a
stock-proof fence. For horse it needed to be high, and to be sheep
proof and rabbit – tight. The horses and sheep were confined to the
fields but I wouldn’t say they were rabbit tight as they could and did
use the hedges, like lots of birds and small animals, as a busy
thoroughfare – birds, insects and small animals have their homes and
nests in the hedge, many feed off one another but it is much safer
than passing to and fro in open field.</p>

<p>The hedger cut and chopped out the dead wood. He lopped off the big
chunks so young growth would shoot, strong and vigorous from the
bottom. The half cut branch, seeing that he’s left a sufficient
section of bark on, will grow, sending out side shoots to strengthen
the hedge. To see the hedger at work was a pleasant sight and to hear
him talk: he generally had a fair store of knowledge and legend as his
job took him to the hedgerows that bound the fields and roads of the
whole district. As one passed by he was ever-ready to pass the time of
day. Many people talked with him and gained local knowledge of trees,
copse and farms and nature. Not book-learnt but things his father
showed him as a boy. Knowledge he learnt by contact at his job.</p>

<p>Sometimes his roadside job would cause him trouble for many women
gleaned the hedgerows for dry wood and chips for the cottage fire.</p>

<p>“Save some for tomorrow,” they would say, as he moved a bunch of
thorns to give one an apron full of chips or dry kindling wood. Along
would come others and soon half the village women were imploring,</p>

<p>“Please – you gave to others.” Supply could not keep up with
demand, so the hedger would be pleased to move away from the
roadside near to the village.</p>

<p>A hedger came to work on a roadside hedge near our village. I
chatted with him many times.  He knew me and had cut and laid hedges
for my father on some of our farms. He was known as Ginger – this was
due to his thick mop of ginger hair. He was a wizard with a bill
hook. This double sided, steel bladed tool was square straight edged
along the back with a curved hooked blade on the front. A four or five
inch wide flat piece of steel ten inches long, a six inch wooden
tapered handle fitted in the steel, sort of wrapped around the handle,
which was oft times hand cut and fashioned by the hedger, was six or
seven inches long, an inch round. Where it fitted into the
billhook, it widened to an inch and half, curved on the front. The
back was straight. This tool was always sharpened two or three times
a day whenever the hedger stopped for a bite of food. In
the bottom of the lunch basket was his tone and after a break,
with his pipe in mouth, the billhook handle clenched in his
knees, the blade stood up as the hedger sat on the bankside of
the hedge as he would dry or oil stone sharpen his billhook with a
half round motion of strokes. So fine was the edge that he could cut
a match straight down the middle.</p>

<p>As I watched him cut backhand and forehand, I could picture our
ancestors fighting with double two handed battleaxes. The hedger
cuts, slashes and weaves his hedge. The two must be related.
To get back to Ginger – he cut and laid miles of hedges and he
was always in great demand. Now Ginger was a bachelor and would
lodge with cottagers of time-workers on the farm, where he was
hedging. He wasn’t fussy – the shepherd’s hut would do. I have
known him to bed down in our barn for a few nights:</p>

<p>“Till I get myself fixed up,” said Ginger. Ginger was working on
our neighbour’s farm near Souldern, one winters night about seven
o’clock – there came a loud knocking on our farmhouse kitchen door. Of
the two dogs, Bob the sheepdog outside, just gave a woof woof. Sort of
to say someone’s about, no stranger, but the spaniel in the kitchen
was in good voice being disturbed from her slumbers. The storm lantern
was always kept alight, hanging just by the door. I went to the door
taking the lantern. As I opened the door there stood Ginger, all six
foot two of him.</p>

<p>“Can I see the Master?” he implored. “I’m proper done, flummoxed, I
be”</p>

<p>“Come in the kitchen,” I said. “I’ll get the boss.”</p>

<p>Poor Ginger, with a glass or two of home made parsnip wine, Ginger
told his tale of woe.</p>

<p>“Two of ’um, Master, there was,” he greeted my father. “Two of ’um
going at it hammer and tongue – so I bolted.” The tale he told was
real upsetting – he shook his head and supped his wine:</p>

<p>Moffey had let Ginger one of his cottages for 1/6 (One shilling and
sixpence – 71/2 p) a week for the several weeks while Ginger was in
the neighbourhood cutting hedges.  A neighbour next door ‘did for him’
– his washing, cleaning, etc. but no cooking – the woman the other
side did the cooking. All went well for five or six weeks till the
cleaning lady said to a villager,</p>

<p>“The food she (this was the cook lady) cooks him isn’t
fit for a dog.” When Ginger’s cook heard this, she shot out to
Ginger’s cottage just as Ginger had finished eating. It were all
right said he,</p>

<p>“I’ve ett it – the plates clean to prove it.”</p>

<p>All seemed all right but the other neighbour who lived next door,
heard voices and came in to see who it was. That was when the balloon
went up – the two women fighting. Ginger had never seen two women
fight over him before.</p>

<p>“’Andfulls of hair they were a
pulling out of one another, Master – can I sleep in the barn? I’ll get my things later tonight when they two be a ’bed.”</p>

<p>“Yes Joe, certainly, move in. Stay as long as you like – I might
find you a hedge to cut and lay for me away from the village for a day
or two till things quiet down,” said Father.</p>

<p>“Thank you, Master, thank you – I be never going back to live by
them two women, no never no more! Good night, Master and thanks
again.”</p>
