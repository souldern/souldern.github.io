<p>Souldern, like most villages in the district, partook freely in sport
through the years. However, it was mainly the menfolk who played sport
in the form of cricket and football. Unfortunately, for the ladies little was done in
the way of recreation for them. At least two of the larger houses did boast
tennis courts but these were never made available to the village folk.</p>
<p>It could well have been that William Shakespeare had village people in mind
when he wrote:</p>
<blockquote>
All the world’s a stage,<br />
And all the men and women merely players,<br />
They have their exits and their entrances,<br />
And one man in his time plays many parts.
</blockquote>
<p>(A number of people will be mentioned several times in this book in
different roles: their employment, as members of the parish council, or as
actively engaged in the enjoyment of football and cricket.)</p>
<p>Long before the First World War, the village had good football and cricket
teams which more than held their own against other villages in the area. Immediately after the war, a really fit football team always took to the field.
Unfortunately, for the young men returning from the war, they had no jobs to come
back to. There being no transport, they were forced to walk to Deddington three
times a week to sign on the dole. On the walk, they kicked a football down Wharf
Lane and across the meadows to Clifton Mill – a distance of about four miles.
Near their destination the ball was hidden away to await them on their return
journey – after the visit to the Labour Exchange.</p>
<p>
Lord Jersey, who resided at the big house on Middleton Stoney Park Estate,

presents a cup known as the Jersey Cup for competition between the local village
football teams. The final was played on the lovely ground of Bicester Town
Football Club. Needless to say it was a great occasion for the village if the
team reached the final – and if they won the cup then there were great celebra­tions,
each player in the team receiving an inscribed medal which was proudly
displayed on their watch chains.</p>
<p>The first time Souldern won the Jersey Cup they had a really great team
ably captained by Major Wise who incidentally scored the only goal of the match. Two other members of the team were my brothers – Tom and Sam. Father farmed near Souldern at
Chisnell Farm. They were only slightly built chaps but pretty tough and clever
ball players. Keeper Westbury’s sons also played a great part in the victory,
especially Milson who was a wing half. Without a doubt Milson was the most
outstanding player ever to play for Souldern: he was an intelligent player for
the District Team against an Aston Villa XI at Banbury. Milson was also a
useful cricketer.</p>
<p>No-one enjoyed the Jersey Cup victory more than Duchy Bates.
He got his name because when he got excited he tried to talk so fast he often
got the words back to front (Double Dutch). He also led the singing of the
victory song to the tune of “Madamoiselle from Armentiers”:</p>
<blockquote>
Souldern’s won the Jersey Cup – parlie vou,<br />
Souldern’s won the Jersey Cup – parlie vou,<br />
Souldern’s never no more to give it up<br />
Inky pinky parlie vou.
</blockquote>
<p>
Alas, it was to be a long time before the Jersey Cup came to Souldern
again.</p>
<p>Much ado was made in the professional soccer world of the mid-thirties with
the introduction of the “stopper” centre-half. However this system was already
in being, in the Souldern team many years previously, in the person of a slightly
built young chap – namely Frank Reeve. His style of play just happened: he did
not move far from the centre of the field, just pushing the ball forwards or
sideways with his feet or head. His Dad, Walt Reeves, used to say “Our Frank’s
head is a blooming sight harder than mine, the way he keeps heading that
football!”</p>
<p>
A good little tricky player was Duck Castle – needless to say how he got
his nick name. Duck was playing one Saturday afternoon when an opponent got
his studs fastened in the front of his shorts, ripping them apart. There was no
such thing as a trainer on the line with replacement shorts – so an embarrassed
Duck stumbled towards the touch line covering himself as best he could with his
hands. Dodger soon came to the rescue, carrying out a running repair by the
use of his shut knife (pocket knife) and binder twine. Dodger never went out
without his knife and string, irrespective of which clothes he was wearing. One
can well picture him transferring knife and twine from working clothes to Sunday
Best!</p>
<p>Two young players now making their presence felt were the Westbury brothers
– Meyrick and Aubrey. (Later to be my brothers-in-law). The youngest, Aubrey, had been really outstanding whilst
at school, both at football and cricket. He also represented the District
Schools at athletics in both the high jump and the four-forty yards sprint.</p>
<p>Souldern played against Kings Sutton in the final of the Brackley Charity
Cup on Brackley Town Ground. No one gave Souldern a chance. Kings Sutton was
one of the outstanding teams in the district and had poached a number of better
players from other villages to join them. As so often happened, Souldern
brought off the unexpected and won! The two young Westburys were outstanding.</p>
<p>What celebrations took place afterwards! The highlight of the celebrations was
laid on by Dad at his house. Dad was well known for making homemade wine. He
cooked a home cured ham, and the football team and a few supporters were invited


to a get together. Two big saucepans filled with wine were kept hot on the
kitchen range. The Charity Cup then was filled and passed around became so hot that it
was difficult to bear your lips against it to drink!</p>
<p>Two characters present
were Frank and Joe Lake. Neither was ever known to refuse a glass of wine. Frank had a reputation of being the champion for pulling funny faces. He was in
fine form that evening – no doubt helped by the considerable amount of wine
consumed! Joe considered himself a bit of a singer amongst his other
qualifications. Joe was a giant of a man, well over six feet tall, very broad
with a big bushy beard and a voice to match. Whether you wanted to hear it or
not, nothing would prevent Joe from singing his own special song:</p>

<p>Needless to say Frank and Joe had to be carried home and put to bed that night!</p>
<p>
Cricket probably just had the edge over football in popularity – here again
many outstanding personalities emerged. Perhaps the most outstanding was Arthur
Allen – a really top-class bowler. His career spanned many years. When a very
young man, the building of what was known as the “New Line” was taking place.
This was the railway line from Aynho via Bicester and High Wycombe to London
(Paddington Station). This brought many outsiders to the village, including
several men who were good, keen cricketers. They soon started organizing
special matches against teams from London and other places. These folk also
realized that in Arthur Allen they had a player who could hold his own “against
the best of ’em”. Very often Arthur was away playing cricket when his mates

were slogging away on the railway. He was a quiet, unassuming chap with a
friendly smile but he loved to talk cricket, and his eyes would twinkle when he
used to say:</p>
<p>“That was the type of cricket I liked, when I pitched the ball in
the block-hole and it raised up and rapped the batsman’s knuckles.” Arthur
always encouraged the youngsters to play; he was very proud that he assisted his
nephew Meyrick Westbury to develop into such a good all-rounder and one of the
outstanding players in the district.</p>
<p>Arthur Allen’s partner in opening the bowling was George Westbury, who was
pretty fast. George’s outstanding feature was the height he lifted his leg
before stamping it down when about to deliver the ball: this technique
frightened many a batsman facing him for the first time.</p>
<p>Many matches played had lots of talking points, but the one that stands out
was the game against the GWR (Great Western Railway) on their ground in Banbury.
This was a midweek limited overs match for the Banbury Hospital Cup. Souldern
batted first and were all out for twenty runs. No-one thought Souldern had a
chance with such a low score and it was thought to be just a matter of time
before the GWR knocked off the runs.</p>
<p>However, this was not so. Frank Finch
opened the bowling to Bert Dunn, recognized as the best opening batsman in the
district. Frank was a really fast bowler but erratic and temperamental.
Frank’s first ball was super: very fast and on the off-stump. It was too good
for Bert Dunn, who just got a faint touch. The ball flew to Frank Humphriss at
first slip like lightning and he caught it with both hands as clean as a
whistle and as if to say: “I do this sort of thing every day.” Poor old Bert
Dunn – he just stood still, looking at Frank Humphriss in disbelief. Then, like
the great sportsman he was, he shook Frank by the hand and congratulated him.
Many present at that match were convinced that if Frank had not caught that ball
it would have gone clean through him!</p>
<p>The Souldern bowlers went on to excel

themselves that night and, backed up by good fielding, dismissed the GWR for ten
runs. It was a tense game, especially for George Watts, who admitted he was
praying that the ball did not go his way, as he was sure he was so keyed up he
would not have stopped it – let alone caught it. Even today, many years later
George still gets butterflies in his tummy when that match is being discussed.</p>
<p>The cricket ground was in the Park and made a lovely setting.
Unfortunately, the Park was ploughed during the Second World War and has not been
used for sport since – a great pity!</p>
<p>Sport played such a big part in the life of the villages prior to the
Second World War and people went to great lengths to ensure its success. In
those days buses were few and far between, and cars for working-class people
were unheard of.</p>
<p>Bodicote, a village near Banbury, was playing Souldern on
Saturday. To get to Souldern, they came on a Midland Red bus to Aynho, walked
through the “Dark Alley” and across the Park, carrying their cricket kit – a distance of about a mile. The Souldern people could see them in the
distance from the cricket ground. The Bodicote team were led by Wil Hitchman, a
Souldern man who had married a Bodicote girl and settled there. Luckily they
did not have the walk back after the match, but went on the Oxford bus which
called at Souldern in the evening en route to Banbury. It is difficult to
imagine many young chaps being prepared to undertake such a journey today.</p>
<p>George Belcher was captain of the Souldern team for a number of years and was a farmer at Nell Bridge Farm. He was a jolly chap, always smiling, and he
also liked a glass of beer. Before every match he would announce:</p>
<p>“I shall not
be staying on tonight. I have to get back to feed the pigs.” However, when the
rest of the team went for a drink, George had to succumb. After about an hour,
when George had got his taste for the ale, his eyes would light up and he would
say:</p>
<p>“Ah, those pigs will have to have a streak of lean tonight.” Then he would


settle down until “Time” was called.</p>
<p>Two stalwarts in the sporting life of the village could be called cripples – Walter Rouse and Ned Morris. Walter was mainly engaged with cricket and Ned with  football. Walter had a club foot but it did not stop him from getting
around. He rode his cycle miles to away matches with his score book, a pair of
pads and a cricket bat tied to the carrier of his bike. Strangely enough, both
these chaps were cobblers, which of course proved very handy because they
carried out any repairs needed for the kit.</p>
<p>Ned only had one leg: he had to
have the other amputated when a young man – but my word, couldn’t he get just
get around with the use of a crutch, especially at football. Imagine the long
strides he could take, and even when someone was nearer to the football than he,
he was deft at hooking the ball away with his crutch. Of course, he was not
allowed to play in proper matches, although his services would have been welcome
on many occasions. He also took his turn with bat and ball during cricket
practice sessions.</p>
<p>Joe Lake has already been mentioned, but one could go on and on writing
about him.  For a great many years he was a “Knight of the road” (a tramp).
During his travels he always managed to see the Australian Cricket Team in
action when touring the country. Joe was a knowledgeable cricketer, and loved
nothing better than to be with the schoolboys, either relating his thoughts
about the best players he had seen, or coaching the boys. The young lads
thought a great deal of Joe. Prior to a coaching session, Joe had all the boys
grouped around him, showing them how to hold their hands when making a catch.
When demonstrating with the bat, he drove home his points with little sayings
such as:</p>
<p>“When playing a rising ball use Douglas Jardine’s half-cock”. If the
batsman did not know whether to play forward or back, it was: “When in doubt
push out.” His own favourite was:</p>
<p>“When the ball is bowled down the leg side,
turn your arse to the wicket and slog.”</p>
<p>
After Joe had given his little talk and the practice had started properly, Joe always had first bat. He would set the field to get the boys used to the
various positions but before the bowler started to bowl he would shout out:</p>
<p>“Are
you ready?” to which all the fielders had to answer:</p>
<p>“Yes, Joe.” On one occasion
he was going through this procedure “Are you ready?” and “Yes, Joe” had been
called and the ball was bowled down the leg side. Joe correctly turned his arse
to the wicket and slogged, hitting the ball full on the face of the bat. It went
like lightning straight to Ken Fathers fielding at square leg, hitting him with
a thud on the chest. Ken started to cry and Joe bellowed out:</p>
<p>“Why din’t you
catch it?” to which Ken replied:</p>
<p>“Joe, I wasn’t ready.” What Joe called him was

nobody’s business. For many years afterwards Joe loved to relate that story.</p>
<p>Many of the boys were much better players because of the coaching given by Joe.
He also felt very proud when one of his prodigies made his way into the village
team, especially when they subsequently did well.</p>
<p>
Lord Cotonham lived at Hill House, which is situated on the outskirts of
the village on the Somerton Road. One day several of the boys went to his house
and asked his lordship if he would like to contribute a fund so that a cricket bat could be purchased. He told the boys he would think it over. Imagine their
surprise when the Lord’s secretary turned up at the school with two new cricket
bats and a new leather ball for the use of the boys. After thanks had been
expressed by the Headmaster (Jimmy Wills) and the secretary had left, the lads
responsible were hauled out in front of the whole school. The Headmaster then
proceeded to give them a good ticking off for their cheek in approaching such an
illustrious personality. It did not make much impression on the boys, all they
could see were two brand new bats.</p>
<p>At about the same time the parson, Reverend
Bently, asked if there was any other kit required – and he gave a pair of real

leather wicket-keeper’s gloves. The schoolboy cricketers now considered
themselves rather important, because prior to this, their main source of
equipment had been old kit handed down by the men players. Those bats, balls
and gloves provided the boys with many hours of enjoyment over a great number of
years.</p>
<p>A number of people are well worthy of a special mention. Percy Taylor was
a keen boxer and skilful too. He learned his craft with Deddington Boxing Club and used to cycle there for training or bouts every week. He was the talk
of the village after an occasion at Banbury Fair. Percy accepted the challenge
to go into the ring at the boxing booth to last three rounds against their
black heavyweight. If he succeeded he would get three pounds, which was a
lot of money in those days. Unfortunately,  Percy had to quit in the third
round, after having held more than his own for the first two rounds. Of course,
what was not known at the time was that Percy had been to a dentist just prior
to the fight to have a tooth extracted; they came tough in those days.</p>
<p>
Perhaps the best known boxer was Ron Gibbs. As a boy he had shown no
inclination for boxing, and when he left school he went to work on Chisnell Farm. However, my father and brother were both keen boxers and that soon
started Ron off. He was no stylist but he was fit and tough. No matter how
hard he was hit it did not seem to make any impression on him and he would
come up for round after round, battling through them at top speed.</p>
<p>The boxing activities centred on Andy’s Garage, Banbury and Ron often appeared on the same
bill as the Turpin Brothers, Dick and Randy, who were just beginning to make
their names known in the boxing world.</p>
<p>What perhaps was one of Ron’s 
outstanding bouts took place in a Boy’s Club in Bicester watched by no more than
fifty people. It was supposed to have been an exhibition bout, arranged to
raise money for the Club. His opponent was of a similar mould, and they really

put on a great show with no quarter asked or given. What a pity more people did
not witness it – this bout would have graced many a fancy hall.</p>
<p>Frank Humphries probably did more than any other person in working for the
football and cricket activities over many years. He worked on Aynho Estate and
lived in the Lodge House at Park Gates. He made himself responsible for
ensuring that the football pitch was marked out and that the cricket pitch was
always mown and marked. He never received payment for this work.</p>
<p>Frank was
also a good all round sportsman. He was an outstanding goal-keeper and this
was during the period when goal-keepers were not protected players as they are
today. He had one weapon in his armoury though, which served him well, and
that was his ability to punch the ball. His hands were as hard as teak and
when the ball was coming towards him, with the opposing forwards bearing down, he
would clench his fist, draw back his arm and punch the ball with the thumb part
of his hand so hard and with such a thud that the ball was sent well over the
half way line. Many a forward has been heard to say:</p>
<p>“Thank goodness he hit the
ball and not my head, as he would have knocked it off!”</p>
<p>Frank opened both the
batting and bowling for the cricket team for many years and he also captained
the team with distinction. They don’t come any better than Frank Humphries.</p>
<p>Will Parker, who lived in Woodcote, one of the big houses in the
village – did not usually associate himself with the sporting activities. One
day, however, he surprised everyone: Will was the proud owner of the first
wireless set (radio) in the village and one Saturday afternoon in April at ten minutes
to five o’clock he was walking up the street asking any folk if they
wanted to know who had won the FA Cup. Of course, everyone replied they did, and
Will promptly answered:</p>
<p>“Bolton – one to nought.” Bolton had beaten Arsenal one-nil at Wembley Stadium and this was the first time that Cup Final had been
broadcast. The mystery was – how could Will Parker have sat for nearly two

hours listening to the broadcast of a football match, for he was a man who just
could not sit still and do nothing, but was always looking for something to do.</p>
<p>Frank Finch has already been mentioned in respect of cricket, but he was 
also a useful footballer. He reached his greatest heights, however, through
playing darts. He was really outstanding, and was the “hottest favourite” ever
to play in the final of the “News of the World” darts competition, which took
place at Shoreditch. Although supported by many villagers on the night, success
was to elude him, and he was narrowly defeated.</p>
<p>The Second World War changed the face of sport in the village. Three
younger chaps who were obviously going to shoulder the responsibilities for many
years,  were called up for War Service. Aubrey Finch, younger brother of Frank
had developed into a first class fast bowler, and he was regularly taking three
and four wickets every match. He went into the army and transferred to the
Airborne Division. It was a sad day in village when it learned that he
had been killed in the ill-fated Arnhem Battle.</p>
<p>Meyrick Westbury outstanding at cricket and also a useful footballer, had
captained the cricket team before he was called up into the Army Service Corps.
After the war he went to live in Banbury.  He continued to play cricket but he
also took up golf and darts and became an above average player at both games.</p>
<p>Aubrey Westbury, also went into the army in the Oxfordshire an Bucks
Light Infantry. He soon gained a place in the Battalion football team, playing
in many countries where duty took him. On leaving the army he joined the
Birmingham City Police and continued his sporting activities. Over the years he
captained both the cricket and football teams.</p>
<p>Over the years new faces have come on the scene. The sports field is now
at Souldern Gate in Bovewell, where a modern hall has been built with good
changing facilities. Although the rules for the various competitions have

changed, the village is still enjoying its fair share of success, including a
recent victory in the Jersey Cup. It is to be hoped that sport will continue to
thrive in the village, and the future looks promising – and sport seems just as
important as ever it was.</p>
