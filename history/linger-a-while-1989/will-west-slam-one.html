<h2 id="TOC-WILL-WEST-SLAM-ONE-">WILL WEST (SLAM ONE)</h2>

<p>
As I rode down the lane on Billy my pony homeward bound
from school, I met Will West (Slam I) as he was known. With Sam his
whippet dog Slam I walked the four lanes west of the village daily.
Wharf lane down one laneside hedge and back up the other
side. Sam searched the hedges and fields, first one side, on the
return the other. I met him on his way back from searching lower lane
hadges. Slam I had already walked Middle lane and Upper
lane in the mornings as was his custom. &ldquo;Hello&rdquo; I said as I
reined my pony in and stopped to chat. &ldquo;Haven&rsquo;t seen you lately&rdquo;
Slam I leaned on his tick, the picture of a worn-out old man.
He was always dressed the same, a pair of grey britches, black
boots and leggings (polished daily) a cap, muffler knotted
around his neck, with a big over jacket with two large poacher pockets
running around the width of the jacket. There was plenty of
space in these deep roomy pockets to conceal rabbits, hare,
partridge, or pheasant. Slam I sold all and any to his
neighbours and had plenty left for himself. Many a gravy pudding
was enjoyed for a shilling &mdash; his charge for a rabbit. This was
a Souldern expression when a rabbit was bought from him &ldquo;There
you are missus &mdash; a good gravy pudding for your family&rdquo;</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Haven&rsquo;t been out much&rdquo; said Slam I. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve had the screws last
six or seven weeks &mdash; I ent bin too good at all &rdquo; He pushed his cap
back with one hand and resting the other on his back &ldquo;A touch of
the &lsquo;can &rsquo;t helpt its&rsquo; I calls it. But I thought I&rsquo;d come out
today, I&rsquo;ve come further than I should, I b&rsquo;ent no good, I dun&rsquo;t
know how I shall get back hum&rdquo; Sams sensitive nose was snifting
the hedge a few yards away, then in he jumped. &ldquo;Look out&rdquo; said
Slam I, &ldquo;ol Sams got a rabbit.&rdquo; I swear Slam I jumped three foot
in the air as he dashed off alongside the hedge. Sam turned the
rabbit out, right by Slam I. Whack! his stick came down as he
said &ldquo;Slam I had her.&rdquo; All the strength left him as he picked
the rabbit up. &ldquo;Pesky thing&rdquo; he said as he opened his jacket and
pushed it in well into his pocket with a struggle and buttoned
up his jacket. He picked up his stock. &ldquo;Darn&rsquo;t know how I&rsquo;ll
get hum &mdash; that I don&rsquo;t&rdquo; as he tottered onto the lane road leaning
heavily on his stick and struggled for home. Sam his dog and
friend walked behind him. I swear as that old dog winked at me
as he passed, he&rsquo;d heard it all before, or was it what do you
think of that &mdash; not bad for a couple of old ones!</p>

<p>
As Slam I walked the lanes he paused as he came to the village
and stopped to talk to the chaps stood at Bates corner. There
was in the twenties always twenty or thirty men (boy chaps
(teenagers)) out of work stood mostly by the corner of the
street, or on wet or windy days crammed in the jietty by the
village pump. Everything was discussed about the village,
gardens, homes, families, anything and everything. One time Slam
I stopped, they were talking about shaving. How long do you go
between shaves. One chap went three days, others as much as a
week between shaves. &ldquo;Well&rdquo; said Slam I &ldquo;I annt had a shave for
eight or nine days this week&rdquo;, being as its Thursday I shan&rsquo;t
shave to the weekend, Saturday I specs.&rdquo; Beside the screws Slam
I suffered with corns. Going into the shop he asked for a pot
of raspberry, strawberry &mdash; &ldquo;Oh my dang corn&rdquo; as he hopped about
the shop. The poor old chap was forever after that asked &ldquo;How&rsquo;s
your corn Will &mdash; be um troublesome Will&rdquo; We children, cheeky
little so and so&rsquo;s, would shout &ldquo;a pot of raspberry strawberry
oh my corn&rdquo;!! Not that it worried him, as he said, he didn&rsquo;t give
it &ldquo;No never mind&rdquo;.</p>
