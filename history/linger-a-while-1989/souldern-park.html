<h2 id="TOC-SOULDERN-PARK">SOULDERN PARK</h2>

<p>As a small boy of five or six years, to be allowed to go down to
Souldern Park with the Big Boys was a treat: Also an endurance test –
the boys were two, three and four years older than me, my brother
included. We all walked miles, climbed fences and trees and scaled six
foot walls.  We also jumped ditches and streams all at a boy’s
exciting pace.</p>

<p>“Look at this.”</p>

<p>“What you got?”</p>

<p>Scrambling, scampering, all eager to seek and find. What days they
were!</p>

<p>The skeleton of a deer trapped in a wire fence; a dead owl tied to
a tree branch by one wing by the gamekeeper – to protect the young
partridges – All blowing in the breeze. Young rabbits, dozens of them
everywhere, and birds. Those spring mornings, the smell of the wood,
the trees, moss, damp soil, the vision of woodland flowers. A glade of
bluebells, primroses, and then to see the first violets that hid and
had to be found. Not the primrose, that always seemed to peep out of
all sides, making a yellow carpet: Down in that carpet was the
shrinking violet.</p>

<p>An old thorn bush, entwined branches, covered in white flowers
looking up at the tall trees. The blue sky with scudding white
clouds. The ground now carpeted with moss, or wood anemones, looking
like white elves dancing. The fallen trees – to walk from trunk to tip
to search in it for birds’ nests, squirrel dreys or whatever.  The
blackbirds, scolding us – for they were being disturbed. The gentle
breeze always in the trees. The gentle “tick, tick” of a little wren
as it flew in and out of the bush, never very far, always in contact
as if it must show you through his domain with no sign of fear. This
tiny bird kept pace with us eight or nine boys.</p>

<p>Dead twigs snap, last years leaves line our path and rustle as
we walk. A rabbit suddenly appears before us, lopes lazily
and quietly away. Another blackbird flew out of a bush
scolding, grumbling and much fussing pretence.</p>

<p>It came – a shower of rain, so light, descending more like a mist
as you looked around. You looked into a green brown mist, through
which the big tree trunks loomed up to the sky. The raindrops seemed
to dance from leaf to leaf. The murmur of the trees and the swish of
the rain so blended in with themselves. The tiny wren still kept pace
with us, moving with darting flights, fearless and so small, past its
surroundings.</p>

<p>We followed a track that lead where?  Apparently to nowhere. In an
 aimless irresponsible fashion and, like all boys, we were following
 it without any plan or purpose.  A cuckoo was calling near at
 hand. The mellow notes seemed to lure us on and on. It was in that
 direction we were walking towards the sound, if any definite way. Not
 that it mattered, that exquisite spring morning. The trees and the
 bushes beneath them were coming into leafy bud, small crumpled leaves
 of the daintiest green. Here and there a silver birch was adorning
 itself with a fine tracery of green. In contrast the ivy, dark green
 in colour, clinging to the big firs so rich in contrast to the brown
 dead leaves underfoot.</p>

<p>The rain stopped and the sun
slanted through the trees. Suddenly the wood was transformed,
the trees awoke in many colours to perfect vivid life. Straight
away a gorse bush was transformed into a pyre of blazing yellow
flame. It was as if fairies were changing the wood into
fairyland. They caressed a thorn tree, which was bursting into
flower and made it a thing of white beauty. They touched the
primroses that peeped from every side in soft colour. They
opened out the hiding places of the shy sweet violets.</p>

<p>Then with
the sun, they danced away, almost with abruptness, they were gone.
The wood seemed to shiver as the dark grey clouds swiftly
scurried ahead. The sun hid its face.</p>

<p>Far away I heard the patter of rain. As it came towards us, we felt
the cool freshness on our faces. I was thankful, for we had been
travelling for an hour, non stop, up and over, and through all and
everything. Not for anything would I admit that the pace was too fast
for my little legs to go. We crouched under a dead, uprooted beech
tree that lodged half down another tree, forming a bridge which
we <i><b>had</b></i> to explore.</p>

<p>When the rain ceased a few minutes after, the sun
shone through and fairyland was again dressed in all its glory.
As I left our shelter, I looked back at the half fallen tree, it
was like a warrior king fallen in battle supported by his worthy
knight, as he was falling mortally wounded. How many battles had
he fought and won? But the last was too much. He would not 
survive, that fallen tree. Hundreds of gales had blown and torn
at his limbs and branches but now it was finished, it was a truly
dying King.</p>

<p>On we went until we came to the Park wall: Six feet of it. To
me it could have been a house or a church steeple, it looked so
high, but following the others I hoped for a way up and over,
We walked alongside for a hundred yards and here was a branch leaning
by the wall which we could shin up and over. So over they went.</p>

<p>“Go back, Little’un!” were their parting words as they dropped over
the other side.</p>

<p>Go back – Me? Not ever – I was half way up the wаll, I would show
them!</p>

<p>Three quarters of the way up, it was a drag – I didn’t know my bum
was so heavy – hanging back down, it was twice as heavy as the rest of
me.  Taking a fresh hold, sticking my toes in the wall then telling my
backside to come on up and not hang back, there I gave a last
determined effort and was up on top of that six foot high wall: the
rest was easy – all that goes up must come down. Hanging on with tooth
and nail, I slithered down without looking at the ground
beneath. ‘<i>The bigger they are the harder they fall</i>’, thought
I. ‘<i>As I am a little one, I shall make it</i>’ – I hit the ground
feet first.</p>

<p>
My first thoughts were “<i>Where are the others?</i>” Rubbing my hands
down my shorts, a quick look at my grazed knee then I turned and ran
towards the boys who I could hear talking down Mill Lane, out of
sight. I sprinted around the bend in time to see them climb over the
stile and take off across the Station Fields. At the next stile, I
caught up with the boys, as they were stood deciding which way to go
to. It was decided to make for the trout stream where it flowed into
the canal by the drawbridge. (We saw birds nesting as we went).</p>

<p>Making our way across the fields, we saw a
moolyhern (heron) by the canal bank feeding a young baby heron.
We watched as the chick ate and then ran to see it. As we came
close, we could see it was all stomach and penfeathers – about a
foot long. We guessed it was twelve to fourteen days old.</p>

<p>From the time it is hatched, the baby heron eats large and
continuous amounts of food. It was an education to watch it consume
frogs and fish as fast as the parents could provide it. Its great
gaping mouth opened and down it went into that big stomach, filling it
right up to its neck. If the parent bird stops for a minute, the chick
squawks loudly for food. The bird is crammed with so much food, that
they grow so fast that the change can be seen happening – the
penfeathers change to real feathers in seven weeks. At nine weeks old,
the bird was three feet tall. Flying short clumsy flight from tree to
tree. He flapped his great wings at us when we got too near and, still
awkward with his long legs, he waded out to the canal and now he was
feeding himself.</p>

<p>From the start of his life he was not strong or able to defend
himself or scurry away. He squawked and used his beak and put on a
bold front then stretching up to his twelve inches, he would fall
over.  We teased him by taking some of his food that was spilled over
on the bank and dangled it in front of him. He would stand on his
wobbly legs and would implore you with such woeful cries to “Feed a
poor suffering baby bird."</p>

<p>Nature is a wonderful thing; we marvelled at the food in the
extended body (undigested), not that the parents had time to do
anything, the chicks lusty appetite kept them so busy. At nine
weeks they left him. We watched for hours.</p>

<p>The heron is one of the earliest nesting birds hereabout and they
have, by the middle of March mated, built or rebuilt their nest, often
returning to the same tree. Older people told us that fifty years ago
(1870–80) there was a heronry where the blue heron came every February
like the rooks to the rookery, to mate and breed, but in my youth only
odd couples were to be seen in this nest. A very shallow one, in a
dead fir tree – near the top, which had been blown down, chick and
all, to the ground. Some of the nest was halfway down, caught in the
lower branches which also, no doubt, cushioned the fall of the chick
to the ground. There may have been more than one, the heron lays three
eggs and sometimes a clutch of four lovely sky-blue and really
beautiful, unspotted in a big structure of twigs and branches of
mostly birch on the remaining structure of the old nest.</p>

<p>The heron flies a long way to find the best fishing, where he loves
to stand in the shallow, hours at a stretch, jabbing his sword-like
beak in lightening flashes. The fish don’t stand a chance. The call of
the blue heron is a harsh “crank, crank,” but when it comes to nesting
they do a “clickety, clickety, click.” It sounds as if their long
beaks are clamping together.</p>

<p>These slow flying birds, taking a trip to their favourite fishing
ground and back, were a very familiar sight alongside the canal
  and streams hereabout.</p>
