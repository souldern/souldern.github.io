<p>
Badger (George Page) was the last real drover in this area, he just drove
cattle, no other work. My when it was a warm day you kept the windward side of
Badger for a ½d (a ha’ penny) he would shed his coats, waistcoats, pullovers, jackets – all 9
or 10 or more! Badger carried his wardrobe on him, summer and winter, it kept
the sun off and the cold out – so he said.</p>
<p>He walked miles with a good stick
and his tin tea can, from farm to market, or market to farm, driving cattle – a
short thick set man, always a smile and a cheery word. Oft times George the
Badger drove cattle for my father. When he came to the farm to fetch or bring the
cattle, he had a handout – a can of tea; bread and jam; bread and
bacon; bread and cheese or cake and pudding. If it was morning and he was going
to market, tea and bread and bacon and a few coppers, anything from 3d to 5d no
more. If late morning it was half a loaf and a chunk of cheese and a bit of
pudding – if it was a big bit of pudding he would throw the bread away and keep
the cheese for a day when there was no work. It was easy to get a stale loaf
from the Deddington bakers and he was a Deddington man by birth.</p>
<p>
He lived in a farm shed, the end of the lane that passed Doctor Turner’s
house, Deddington. If it was late afternoon and Badger had driven cattle to
market for someone and then driven a herd of cattle back to our farm, it could be
five or six o’clock in the evening. His day would start at seven am. Often he
had walked forty miles or more, Badger would say:</p>
<p>“Once you got the cattle going,
after the first mile or two, it wasn’t so bad.” At the start with the cattle that had
never been off the farm, you had to go back and across the road to get them
going. They would turn back and twist to go back home and into any hole in the hedge
or an open gate, they got through. You must keep them bunched up tight and be close

up to them. If they looked at a turning or a gate you hustle them along giving
then no chance.</p>
<p>In the evening Badger’s face would be red with exertion of the
drive and he would welcome his can filled, his bread and jam and cake that he collected
from the kitchen door. He never stood around, he would go away across a field
or two, then sit down and have his food and ‘copper up’ as he called – counting his
pennies. Then off to his home he would go, unless Dad had a drive for him the
next day, or a neighbouring farmer, then Badger would kennel up in a shed or a
barn, if not under a hedge or a tree, ready for an early start the next morning.</p>
<p>I think Badger died in his sixties about 1926.</p>
