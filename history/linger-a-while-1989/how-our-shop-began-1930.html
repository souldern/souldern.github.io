<p>
We were farmers growing potatoes on our farms. Dad sold hundred weights (cwts – a hundred and twelve pounds [lbs] in weight) or
half cwts, as he delivered milk around the village with a pony
trap, from a churn into a hand can, from door to door, in pints
or half pints to villagers, on the doorstep into jugs.</p>
<p>There were three shops. No-one sold vegetables at all in
Souldern. In 1930 there was a shortage of potatoes in Souldern,
Dad sold all ours and had to buy. Then he bought new. Someone
asked “Can you get bananas?” – we did.</p>
<p>All people couldn’t afford 112 or 56 lbs potatoes at 3/- (3 shillings =15 new pence) or 1/9d (one shilling and nine pence = 9 new pence):
So mum had scales and bagged the potatoes in the front room – 7 lbs for 3d.</p>
<p>Holidays and weekends it was often my job to do the milk round.
Dad could always find an excuse so that I should do his job.
After potato and banana customers asked for other fruit and veg.
So slowly we got into greengrocery, fruit and vegetables, the
lot. You could go into the three other shops, one was the Post
Office and groceries and the other two Bakers and Grocers.
Sweets were mainly kept in tins on the top shelf, they would
climb up get the tin down. A newspaper cone was put on the
scales first, then sweets put carefully in with much pressing
with shopkeepers’ finger pushing scales towards the required
weight. The mean, stingy so and so’s.</p>
<p>One day three of us had
a penny each, twice Miss Boddington sprinted up the steps at a
snails’ gallop, keeping one eye on us, defying us to breath ’till
she completed her task. As she was about to replace the lid for
the second time “I suppose you would like ha’porth of these Jack”
(We mostly spent in halfpennies)</p>
<p>“Oh no thank you Miss” said I.

With a sniff and a shake of her head she replaced lid, up the
steps with the tin, down she came, put the steps away</p>
<p>“What would
you like?”</p>
<p>“A penny’s worth, please,” I said with a smile all so
innocent. . . . . How much paper and how many times had she sold her
fingers, how sweet was my revenge!!!!</p>
<p>As a child the poor selection and service made a deep impression
on me and would be the beginning of the end of these stingy mean
people.</p>
<p>I was the youngest of 4 boys, working on our farms with horse
power, walking back and forth across fields. From 6 or 7 years
old I had to walk miles, my feet nearly killed me and when I left
school at 13 and a bit. . . . . Our farmhouse was 3 miles away at
Chisnell Farm, I would take my heavy farm boots off because my
feet hurt and swelled so during the day I wouldn’t be able to get
them back on. So after pain and tears for years my father took
me to the doctor. “This lad has sensitive feet, he must not wear
heavy boots or wellingtons, off the farm he must go.” With that
my father said to me take the pony and trap and sell fruit and
veg. “I can do that” said I. We had moved up into the village
of Souldern to live by this time and we had started the shop and
milkround a year or more.</p>
<p>Towards Christmas and seven or eight of we chaps were singing
carols for something to do one night. One lad beat time on this
tin box thing. The shopkeepers were Londoners, a man and wife,
Dave and Lil, who were only here a few years, 4 years I think
(Furriners). Dave soon came out, “Clear off you village louts.”
he yelled, “No more of that, GET” That really put the lads back
up. Then five minutes later I moved back to the tin, everyone
watching the shop door. The dispenser was fixed on the wall
between the shop window and their sitting room window. Lil was
stationed, unknowingly to us, behind the curtain, Dave was around
the back of the house with his belt. Bang, bang, I clouted the
Sharpes tin. Just at that moment Tim Coleman walked by, around
from the back came Dave, belt buckle end swinging, Tim took one
look over shoulder at Dave, Lil seeing Dave taking after Tim
banged on the window so hard it broke the glass. Tim flew down
the street, Dave thinking Tim had broke the window, printed after
him, to our de light in vain, Dave was no match. Back he came “It
wasn’t him it was young Callow” shouts Lil “I saw him.” “Who
broke the window?” asked Dave. “I did” said Lil . “why” said
Dave “I was trying to stop you, it was young Callow” “I got a
toffee bar” said I chewing my tongue “here’s the wrapper off it.”
said one of the lads with me. “You shouldn’t have done it Lil”
said Dave. We lads moved off very pleased with ourselves.</p>
<p>
We were very busy with the fruit and veg shop and the cony and
trap. One customer said to us “could you get some 1/2d sweets?”
(Sweets were still sold from tins). “Yers” we said. Away we went
to Banbury. I was now driving a small 8 cwt Morris van and going
to a dozen or more villages, twice a week. As a boy I heard a
boy from Clifton village yodelling down in the meadows by the

River Cherwell. I have always loved singing, soon I was
yodelling back to him from Chisnell on the hill across the
valley. We had lovely sessions. His name, a nickname was Toego,
I was Callow. What fun we had. When I started around the
villages I would yodel, “Hellooo its Callooooo.”</p>
<p>
We put over 50 different 1/2d. boxes of sweets on a table of
orange boxes, in what we called the bakehouse, now known as Jack
Start cottage, where I started my shop. The kids went mad. Soon
the news got to other villages. It was a sell out.</p>
<p>
In those days food came with the seasons, in the good weather
eggs were plentiful, and the same with fruit and veg, so the
first crop of any season was a treat. We sold plums at 7–lb for 6 old pennies (5p today) and 12–lb sugar for two shillings and
2 old pennies (12p today). Everyone made their own jam and
there’d be a rush to get the fruit boiling and the jam
stacked in neat rows in the larder – for it had to last till the
next lot of fruit was ready. Coxes sold at 2 old pennies for the
1–lb and Blenheims even cheaper at 1–lb for ½ an old penny.</p>
<p>
The children running past Dave and Lil’s shop with ½d sweets
annoyed them. Their sweets didn’t sell. Two or three mornings
after the ½d sweet sensation Dave and Lil were waiting for dad
with his milk float. “Your a farmer, you sell  milk and
greengrocery, now you are selling sweets” Dad said “Until we
sold greengrocery no one sold any in the village, you now sell
some as the other two shops do. This is all right for you to
sell what you like but not for us” “Well” said Dave, “if you
sell sweets we won’t have your milk and we shall tell our


customers not to deal with you.” “Right”, said dad, “if you want
a war you shall have one. We will sell groceries of all sorts
and like the 1/2d sweets we will give the villagers what they want,
not what you want them to have. They will have selection and variety.”</p>
<p>I finished the milk round, dad went to Grimbly and Hughs of
Oxford and ordered a full range of groceries. . . . . Now we were in
business with a difference. Now we would show them what
villagers would do. They sold up at the Post Office in a few months
and went back to London. In seven years Titcombes, Bakers
and grocers sold up to the Co-op. About ten years after,
Boddington’s grocers and bakers ceased to sell anything. The
Boddington’s two spinsters and two bachelors all in their
seventies, ceased to scratch for a living. One of the brothers
was known as scratchit.</p>
<p>In 1946 a young girl living in the village went to work at the
Co-op. Two years on June 5th 1948 I married that young lady,
Mary. She came, bringing a good few customers, just around the
corner, now Jack Start Cottage. Needless to say the Co-op closed
a few years later. In 1972 we built a new shop with flat, on a
plot of land adjoining the old Co-op, now the village garage
service station. This land I bought when I first started in
business 45 years before, one day to build my shop on, at the
price of a fat pig – £30 – value.</p>
<p>One Saturday evening about 1933/4, Christmas, I was driving from
Croughton to Hinton in the Hedges with my mobile shop when a big
badger ran across the road in front of a car. The car’s bumper
killed the badger instantly, just in front of me. Immediately
I put on the brakes and jumped out. The badger, a large male,

was dead. The badger (or brock) was a beauty. His fur was sleek and shone
in the van lights. What a good find. I should be able to sell
this to one of my customers on my round. With the help of my
assistant we lay brock on the wing of the van. Four or five hours after,
as we came home, we still had brock. Many customers
would have bought him if we could have skinned him but we had a
round to do, goods to deliver. I drove into Souldern around
10.30 p.m. Brock was warm, laying alongside the engine, when I
pulled in outside our shop. Moffey lived in Halfpenny Cottage,
5 cottages down our street. What a lark – I will put brock on
his cottage step. Well, dear reader, you know what fun we had the next day!!</p>
<p>Retailing from mobile shops, we had many amusing incidents. When
I first started if I hadn’t an item I was asked for I would get
it from another local shop or go to town to purchase it and
deliver later in the day, or very often 9 or 10 p.m. I was 16
years old, got my first motor van and an elderly lady asked me
for something I didn’t have in stock. I’ll drop it in this
evening I told her maid, a village girl my age. That night
at 9.30 p.m. I sprinted around to the back door – you dare not go
to the front – it was the tradesman entrance for the grocer.
Seeing light in the kitchen I opened the door and burst in with
a knock and a “here you are Hilda, Miss McClure’s goods.” There
was a scream and splashing of water “Don’t look, don’t look”
screamed the old Miss springing up prancing around in her tin bath
in front of the kitchen fire. Scared, I was more scared
than she was. I just dropped whatever it was and ran out of the
house, frightened out of my wits. She was still screaming as I

jumped into my van. One day, calling on another customer who
could never find anything – she would set all and everything down
wherever she was when she finished, with big black saucepans on
the table, washing in the chair, knitting on the cooker, when
rationing was during the war she gave us her prayer book. It was
on a Monday and in her handbag after Sunday Church I suppose
“Take my rations out” she said – she was quite sure it was her
ration book. But the best was when I called to delivery her box
of groceries just after she had got her new false teeth. Very
proud of these national health she was – they didn’t fit, she
could hardly speak with them in but she popped them in when
anyone came to the door and gave you a quick flash of a smile.
Made her look years younger she said, then out they came and on
the corner of the table they went, or any corner that was clear.
Now her son brought home a lurcher half grown dog to add to the
confusion. Nellie, hearing me walking up the garden path and
seeing the large box of groceries opened the door wide, before
she located her teeth. The dog rushed in the house, Nellie was
a bit ruffled, she couldn’t find her teeth to give me a flashing
smile “Hello Nellie” I said balancing the box of groceries on a
bag of potatoes. Nellies husband had been sorting in the middle
of the kitchen and left it, was it one or two weeks ago? “Whats
up ma” “I’m flummaxed” said Nellie “why, whats the matter.” I
asked “It’s my teeth, my new teeth – I can’t find um” “Perhaps
the dogs had them” i said joking. He had. You never see such
a mess this half grown dog trying to chew Nellies pride and joy,
her lovely teeth, around the table went Nellie chasing the dog
chewing and chomping her teeth. The dog paused at the open door
and looked back at Nellie as she descended on him, arm

outstretched. I couldn’t decide which mouth they suited the best.</p>
<p>One old age pensioner was given a large branch of tree that had
been blown down during the March winds. He chopped and sawed it
into smallish pieces so that he could get it home but one last
piece was almost as big round as him, so he cut it in large
lengths 2-man pieces. Come winter when I delivered his groceries
he would be sat close to the fire, a great log half on the fire
the other end he rested his foot on. It was very amusing to see
him push with his foot. Two days she’s bin going he said,
daren’t leave her, day or night – I keeps a shoving it on a bit
further and here I sits.</p>
<p>Oft times the wives would cut the husbands ration of cigs,
tobacco or sweets in the grocery order. “He smokes too much, or
eats too many sweets” Many of these men worked on local farms,
or if retired would be in the garden, or waiting along the road
for my mobile. How many she got me this week they would ask – and buy the extras or even get the neighbour to buy for them.
So in the end they had their little luxuries.</p>
<p>Practically everything was sold loose and had to be weighed up – dried fruit, all kinds of sugar, rice, tapioca, sago, lard,
spice, butter, marge, ham – our own cured, boiled in the big
boiler, cut off the bone to the customers requirements. One Oxo
1d, loose biscuits, our own dripping lard, scratchings, soap, shampoo, Persil, long bars of soap, primrose for washing 1 lb mostly 2 1/2 for the wash. 2 lb for 1 1/2d washing soda. No
other was put in the copper to boil, only the blue bag as it was
rinsed and put through the mangle. There were no large giant
packets of soap powder, no liquid soap. 1d packet or 3d tin

blacklead for the fire place fender and irons, 1d balls of
whitening for the hearth surround and front doorstep. We didn’t
sell much bacon at first because everybody almost had a pig to kill.</p>
<p>
Jam was made by the housewife, dozens of pounds of gooseberry,
plum, blackcurrant, and apple and blackberry always there was a
2lb jar on the table at meal times, very rare a 1lb jar,
certainly not the present day 12 oz jar. Sugar came into the
shop in 224 lb (2 cwts) bags. This we weighed off in 2 lbs or
4 lbs, in blue sugar bags retail price 2d a lb., currants,
sultanas and raisins in 40 lb boxes. These were weighed in half
and one lbs into blue bags, sold for 6d or 7d. Cheeses, the big
cheddars, came 2 in a wooden crate 70 lb each (140). We slid them
down into the cellar 6 or 8 at a time to be up-ended every 3 days,
if not the top half of the cheese would be dry, the
moisture would run into the bottom. This mature cheese about 18
months old would then be skinned and the wire cutter cut through
the rind, the lovely smell of cheese would come. Syrup came in
casks, bring your jamjar 8d/lb. If a customer bought a sealed
tin it would cost 10 1/2d. People saved 2 1/2d on lb, same with
vinegar, 3d pint from the cask, 4d if you bought a piint already
bottled. So they brought jugs and had the loose vinegar. Dates
came in wooden boxes held tight with strips of tin 70lbs in a
sticky block. I prised them apart into small lumps weighed off
into lbs, 3d/lb in the blue bags, these were strong and grease
absorbent. Salt, pepper, biscuits, candypeel , spices, cloves – all weighed. Soda 200 to 300 lbs every week that we sold 7lbs
for 6d. People bought lots of soda for cleaning, washing and


families 18 lb every week for cooking, general use, any over was
put in the store cupboard for jams, bottling, wines and possibly
the hives of bees. Matches, another weekly must 6 – 12 boxes,
with fires, coppers, candles, oil lamps and lanterns, not
forgetting oil bicycle lamps. The village shop is and always will
be to some their larger. Being farmers we were always
opening our shop 6 a.m. same times as we milked the cows and
fetched into the stable the shire horses to feed and groom ready
for their working day. Customers, instead of borrowing from
neighbours, soon became early customers at Callow’s – you could
set your clock by them, milk for that breakfast cuppa tea 6 or
just after sometimes, 6.10 a.m. packet of tea, 6.30 a.m. quarter
cornbeef, half cheese, half onions for dads lunch basket. 6.40 – 6.50
the men workers, on bike or on foot for cigs and tobacco.
Some later risers 7 ’ish 7.30 to eight children’s breakfast
cereals, milk, jam, honey etc. 8 to 8.45 breathless children,
cotton, thread, yards and yards of bloomer elastic and ribbons
8.45 – 9.30 a.m. children for school lunch. Sweets, fruit,
biscuits etc. Children RC because ours was a Church of England
missed the first half hour religious instruction, all children
from the outlaying farms. Children from the outlaying farms, our
one at Chisnell 3 miles from school, Keeper Westbury children in
my school days added up to 8 farmers children 10 RC., 4 gamekeepers
children, always 20 odd late comers, oft times we were sliding
on village ponds. We did have 9 in and around Souldern,
scrumping or chards whose owners forgot that some children were
not safely in school. My lunch satchel would be filled with
fruit to share with my school chums. The same late afternoon
children in and out of the shop for the things mum forgot, 4 p.m.

onward 5 p.m. wife dashing in “Bill’s home give me a quarter
rasher and a couple of eggs – I forgot to get anything off the
butchers van.” Then it was pints of milk for baby’s bottle or
milk sops, many children had tea kettle sops. Toasted bread
broken in pieces with tea poured over, with a sprinkling of sugar
on top. Bread and lard, or toast with lard. Very often the lard
had been used up the meal before and the children would dash to
our shop for a pound of lard before tea could commence. Always
in the winter time mother at dusk would to trim the lamp – no
oil, quick one of you children to the shop for a gallon of
paraffin oil. Sometimes dad or big brother had taken the last
box of matches – with the lamp filled and no match to light it.
Nowadays its the quick meal from the freezer. We have dozens of
times at the weekend had mum standing in the shop perhaps with
a teenage daughter trying to decide how big a chicken to have for
lunch at 12.00 or 12.30. The chicken, frozen solid, to be taken
home and got ready for cooking and eaten in less than an hour.
The village shop had a lovely smell all of its own, things were
cut as required, cheese, lard, cooked ham sliced off the bone,
spices and pepper weighed out, loose sausages, biscuits from the
tin – so many different smells – it was beautiful to come through
the shop each smell seemed to meet you. Those early years when
my wife had our annual weeks holiday the first thing we did was
to walk through the shop on our return home – it always seemed
to smell better than before.
