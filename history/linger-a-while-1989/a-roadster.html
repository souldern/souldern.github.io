<h2 id="TOC-A-ROADSTER">A ROADSTER</h2>

<p>A man walked slowly through the village, cap in hand singing
&ldquo;Abide with me,&rdquo; turning sideways, first to the left, then to the
right, with a &ldquo;Thank you man&rdquo; he would step across the road to
collect a few pence. Sometimes a man and woman he would sing and the
woman would knock all the doors, both sides of the street. The man
watching if no-one came to the door. They moved along fast, but if
a few neighbours were talking together then the man would with
feeble voice &ldquo;Rock of ages&rdquo; with special hesitancy, a little cough.</p>

<p>I can remember well the hymns always on Mondays, after Sunday
and the line, &ldquo;Nothing but to thee I cling.&rdquo; One man sung that a
dozen times going through the village. Boy like we wandered up and
down the village street, to see who gave and who didn&rsquo;t. Sometimes
they had a squeeze box (small accordion) or whistle. The last of
these wanderers was a Welsh miner, who through ill health, was with
a tin whistle playing &ldquo;Swanee River&rdquo; and collecting alms, in our
village in the late 1930&rsquo;s. I talked to him, as he paused by our
shop, to drink a cup of tea, mother sent me with telling him how much
I enjoyed his rendering of &ldquo;Swanee.&rdquo; &ldquo;Yes, I could do much
better with a better instrument&rdquo; he said in a quick sort of singing
voice. Of the Welsh &ldquo;you see I used to play in our band, oh &ndash; yes
man. I was in the choir for nigh on 30 years, till the dust got
me.&rdquo; &ldquo;I can tell you&rsquo;re a Welshman&rdquo; I said as he gave the cup back.</p>

<p>Off he strode with a thank you bo-yo. Then with a whistle he
gave me &ldquo;Men of Harlech.&rdquo; I sang and whistled that for days after.</p>
