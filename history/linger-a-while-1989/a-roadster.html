<h2 id="TOC-A-ROADSTER">A ROADSTER</h2>

<p>A man walked slowly through the village, cap in hand singing
“Abide with me,” turning sideways, first to the left, then to the
right, with a “Thank you man” he would step across the road to
collect a few pence. Sometimes a man and woman he would sing and the
woman would knock all the doors, both sides of the street. The man
watching if no-one came to the door. They moved along fast, but if
a few neighbours were talking together then the man would with
feeble voice “Rock of ages” with special hesitancy, a little cough.</p>

<p>I can remember well the hymns always on Mondays, after Sunday
and the line, “Nothing but to thee I cling.” One man sung that a
dozen times going through the village. Boy like we wandered up and
down the village street, to see who gave and who didn’t. Sometimes
they had a squeeze box (small accordion) or whistle. The last of
these wanderers was a Welsh miner, who through ill health, was with
a tin whistle playing “Swanee River” and collecting alms, in our
village in the late 1930’s. I talked to him, as he paused by our
shop, to drink a cup of tea, mother sent me with telling him how much
I enjoyed his rendering of “Swanee.” “Yes, I could do much
better with a better instrument” he said in a quick sort of singing
voice. Of the Welsh “you see I used to play in our band, oh – yes
man. I was in the choir for nigh on 30 years, till the dust got
me.” “I can tell you’re a Welshman” I said as he gave the cup back.</p>

<p>Off he strode with a thank you bo-yo. Then with a whistle he
gave me “Men of Harlech.” I sang and whistled that for days after.</p>
