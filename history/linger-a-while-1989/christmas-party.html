<p>Seeing the Village Christmas Tree was a great occasion for we children. Pony and harness had a annual check – all ready for the trip to the Village Christmas Party. That Saturday Dad would turn the pony trap upside down, take the wheels
off, grease the axle and put the wheels back on the trap.</p>
<p>
The Saturday after Christmas at 3.30 p.m., we three boys would drive off
across the fields bound for Souldern. Chisnell seemed a long way from
the village but Billy put his best foot forward and we entered Souldern
just as it was getting dusk. We stabled Billy in Bates Yard then off
to school with a difference – all village children were there from 3
years to 14. We joined our friends in the schoolyard showing one
another our Christmas presents. In my case, usually a pen knife, tie or
book, sometimes a diary. Then into school:</p>
<p>The Christmas tree was about
18 to 20 feet tall, decorated and lit with candles standing in the north-east corner. Trestle tables were stretching the length of the big room. We sat on forms
and the bun fight started: sandwich, cake, biscuits, jelly, cups of tea.
We took our own plate, cup and spoon. After an hour of feeding and chit chat, Mrs.
Parker said:</p>
<p>“Is it getting darker? Yes, boys.”</p>
<p>We were outside till
 6.30 then on for presents and a sing song of carols. An orange and bag of
 peanuts was given to each child as they went home. Lou would be waiting
at Mr. Bates’ for us – Billy would be hooked up to the trap. Once out
of the village Billy had free rein: He could see better than us.</p>
