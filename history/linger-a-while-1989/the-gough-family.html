<h2 id="TOC-THE-GOUGH-FAMILY">THE GOUGH FAMILY</h2>

<p>
The Gough family go back through the parish history for hundreds of
years. As a boy of 12 years of age when my brother Jesse, aged 15 was
drowned in the Deep Lock, Somerton, near Chisnell Farm we farmed as
tenants of the Goughs.</p>

<p>
I was at school at Souldern and I was asked to go and see Mrs.
Gough a widow lady of a great age she seemed, as she sat in her draw&shy;ing
room dressed in black and almost blind. She was around 90 years
old. She was a very sweet and sympathetic over the loss of my
brother. She told me she had not only lost her husband but also her
only child at a very early age of 6 years old with scarlet fever. It
was so hard to lose a son and she knew how my parents were feeling at
the time.</p>

<p>As a boy I looked with interest at this lonely mother in
her large room with curtains partly drawn to keep some sun out and
noise, so quiet, so subdued, withdrawn &ndash; in my thoughts I can see this
scene. I was so brown and tanned by the sun working in the fields
haymaking &ndash; it was July that the tragedy occurred. I was very
emotionally upset, nothing so drastic had happened to me since losing
Granny Callow some 7 years before. I remember a feeling of great
emotional compassion for this gentle grandmother person with no one to
love, as I stood there and a bond of feeling surged through me as I
took her hand and knelt by her side with tears in my eyes and a sob in
my throat. We held fast for a few moments as my brother&rsquo;s loss
overwhelmed me.</p>

<p>In her sorrow at my distress she talked and calmed me, as no doubt
she had her own son, and after a few seconds I regained my
composure. We talked of the hay and the wet summer and she led me on
in conversation to talk of everyday things school, Souldern etc. and
when I was recovered we parted with a promise to meet again in the
near future. I pressed a kiss on her cheek as I left her sitting with
a half smile on her lips and what thoughts of me my brother or her
family, who knows? I wished that little moment had meant something to
her in her loneliness. How thoughts stray as I walk the village street
like thistledown, they touch my thoughts.</p>

<p>One autumn day I rode my pony &ldquo;Billy&rdquo; galloping down the street
and up the yard entrance to Boddington&rsquo;s the Bakers, pig butchers,
farmers, dairymen and taxi. They were one of the five owners of motorcars
in the village &ndash; the others being one at the court, one at the manor,
one at Manor Farm, and a lorry at Bates, Carrier, and Coal Merchants.</p>

<p>Getting back to Boddingtons Taxi: the bus for Oxford did not come
through Souldern. We had to meet it at Fritwell, so women with small
children and the infirm would hire the taxi.</p>

<p>One very bad foggy night
a woman was returning from Fritwell with a small child and some shopping
when the taxi left the road. Syd stopped and shouted,</p>

<p>&ldquo;Get out and find me the road
I lost it,&rdquo; so the mother clutching the child got out and with a lot
of this way back; now this way forward she got Syd back on the road heading
for Souldern.</p>

<p>Without so much as &ldquo;how&rsquo;s your father&rdquo; Syd kept going: now
he was right he didn&rsquo;t stop to pick up his fare, no matter how she
yelled and ran with child, she was left to walk home, a matter of a mile
and a half, in the dark and fog. As she said, he was alright as he
always collected the fare before he started the journey.</p>

<p>On another time the Boddingtons had gathered their walnuts, the
double ones. We boys had never had much luck scrumping them because
they were guarded so well. But as I rode around to the bakehouse on
Billy, the nuts, those big double juicy milky ones, lay hundreds of
them on sacks.  My mouth waters, now today, at the thought of
them. &lsquo;How?&rsquo; I thought. &lsquo;How I wish .... (as only a young boy could)
...  &lsquo;If only some way?&rsquo; But how?</p>

<p>Out of the blue one of the workmen doing some repairs came by,
taking in the situation very he quickly bent down and grabbed four
large nuts in his hands and just threw them at me. Billy half reared
and turned as I grabbed at the nuts. Two I caught. Into my pocket in a
flash and slipping my arm through the ponies reins I jack-knifed off
Billy, hit the ground, retrieved the other 2 nuts, concealed them in
my shirt and back on the pony in 2 shakes of a dog&rsquo;s tail. The
workman&rsquo;s pleasure at my acrobatics was rewarding enough for him. As
for me, I was the envy of my pals for weeks. How many times we had
searched under that walnut tree and not had one nut between a gang of
us, a dozen or more, and there was me &ndash; four thrown at me. I was a
lucky so-and-so!</p>

<p>To turn the pond corner and walk on up to the school. The clock is
not going for the simple reason that from inside the clock, with the
works and everything, was taken away by the builder who converted the
school into a private dwelling &ndash; leaving only the clock face and the
hands, to this day.</p>

<p>How many times and how many balls had been thrown at those hands
in playtime, afternoon break, etc so that we could go home early? On wet days
the clockface was smothered in wed muddy ball marks. The glass in the
window to the left and below. I had 3 hours off school for that.</p>

<p>During playtime one day I broke it somehow. When we assembled in the
playground to march in some little pet reported me to Sir.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well you
can go and find Art,&rdquo; (the village handyman) I was told. So off I go. Look in the
most opposite direction because who wanted to sit in class 5 and 6 to a form
on a nice summer&rsquo;s day? Freedom was a thing to enjoy and extend as far
and as long as possible. So trying to think up a plan, I strolled
casually up the street almost to the village pump, when out of the
house on the other side of the street, the one before The Olde Forge,
steps the Moffey Man.</p>

<p>
With an exaggerated wave of his arm and a nod, and a dancing step.  He
was good at that sort of tethering one one foot in mid-step. He was a
cough-drop and good for a laugh.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Where you going? Come in for a minute.&rdquo; Not
needing much persuading I told him that I was looking for Handy Art. Like me
Moffey thought I should not hurry things so in I went and here is an
account of the hour or so I spent with Moffey known as the village man with a
double brain: One went one way and the other went off at some queer
angle.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Come in my boy,&rdquo; said Moffey, laughing with tears in his eyes.
He was good at that too.</p>

<p>&ldquo;See what they&rsquo;ve left me, she and them between them... This is it,
what you think of it ay?&rdquo; stopping to light a Player cigarette,
squinting to see the print was on the other end: &ldquo;You get poisoned by
that print,&rdquo; he&rsquo;d told us that dozen of times.</p>

<p>Moffey and his why&rsquo;s and wherefores &ndash; you had to be like a
thrashing machine and sift things out. Like now I didn&rsquo;t know who they
were or she, so I had to bring him back sort of like to the start. For
he had been away, somewhere, no one had seen him for weeks.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t seen you for a few weeks about the
village, been on your holidays or somewhere?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;In the cookshop with a muzzle on,&rdquo; said Moffey, tears of glee
rolling down his cheeks. (Prison) I knew that one Artful Joe and
Moffey had told me years ago.</p>

<p>&lsquo;What? and Why?&rsquo; I wondered, but you had to leave Moffey to spin
the tale.</p>

<p>He told me about his wife who had a rare old time with him and his
sayings, threats and curses. This was the time he had threatened
her. Around the cottage he took me, like a racehorse &ndash; reeling off
this and that as fast as you could read, all by memory.</p>

<p>I had been out over an hour, at 2.30 was
playtime at school. Off I trotted to Sir,</p>

<p>&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t find Art, Sir.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;After break go back and look for him.&rdquo; So after school break off
I went to find the man. I mooched slowly along the Foxside through the
Tchure to Art&rsquo;s workshop and what do you think? He was there. I
explained about the window had a chat,</p>

<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the time?&rdquo; I asked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;3.15,&rdquo; says Art.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Good,&rsquo; thought I. &lsquo;Gently does it.&rsquo; So back I
went at a snail&rsquo;s gallop to school. Five minutes to prayers and the end
of another school day.</p>

<p>The Post Office was kept by Mrs Matthews. Her husband, Bill, was the
retired village postman, all knit up with swellings, screws and whatnot: A
reward for the wet journeys to the railway station to collect and
deliver mail on foot across fields, ploughed or knee-deep in grass,
wading knee-deep through water, snow and most always mud.</p>

<p>Bill was
a friendly man not so his Mrs. At least, we children got the raw side
of her sharp tongue. Not many children liked her. She was a very
clean and efficient person. Everything was clean and tidy inside the
Post Office, outside was a well scrubbed step with a mat on right
alongside the main High Street path. This she guarded jealously. No-one
dare step on it as they passed by only if you were a Post Office customer.</p>

<p>So for kicks one day I said to my schoolmates (Ron known as Smiler as he was
always smiling but later as &ldquo;Sunny&rdquo;. (Moffey gave him a new nickname &ndash; more
later):</p>

<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s step on ole Amy&rsquo;s step as we run down the street to school.&rdquo;
With me leading away we ran hopping onto her step. As I passed then
Smiler, I was 0.K. but Sunny &ndash; bang, he caught it with her broom, straight in
his face. Stopped, dead in his tracks, and turned the waterworks on.
Now Sunny was the one boy that did all her errands &ndash; fetched milk, went
to the shop, took messages or whatever and she was a bit put out when
she saw who she had clobbered.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sorry Son. It was John I meant to
hit not you.&rdquo; Sunny yelled louder. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t cry, I&rsquo;ll give you something.
Wait a min.&rdquo; We, his pals, waited further down street. Two minutes a
smiling Sunny came down to us, a bag of sweets,</p>

<p>&ldquo;You two can have three each. I was hit and I had to cry, thanks!&rdquo;
Now we boys were always thinking up tricks to get sweets, for us there
was no pocket money &ndash; only wages that you worked for. Only to be told
at the end of the week, we had done something wrong or not done
something so no wages. Our parents were good at this. Made us lose our
money. Moffey was picked to fill the pocket one time, Sunny was
helping him and said could I have a few bits of wood to light our mums
fire.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Moffey, &ldquo;sure you
can.&rdquo; Sunny took the few sticks of wood and sold them for
½ d not taking it home! Next day Moffey called,</p>

<p>&ldquo;Come in, come in. You artful young Sunny Jim. You Reuben the screw
bin, the sly little Reuben, ha&rsquo;penny bundle of wood seller.&rdquo;</p>

<p>In the village in the winter nights we children had very little to
do. Some nights several of us 10 to 12 year olds would go and visit
Moffey in his cottage (Now Half Penny Cottage). Why Half Penny
cottage? When clearing the cottage after a tenant, I found 15 or 20
old ha&rsquo;pennies scattered around. Not liking Numbers, I named it ½
penny cottage. This was long after Moffey had moved on and I came to
own the house.</p>

<p>As I was saying, we kids would visit the Moffey to pass a couple of
hours. As you have read to we children, he was a grand entertainer. I
have never heard a person with so many sayings. &ldquo;You included
yourself, if the cap fits, you wear it,&rdquo; he would answer, if you said
&ldquo;Do you mean me,&rdquo; over a matter of word given &ldquo;My words my bond&rdquo; or
talking of the truth &ldquo;lies.&rdquo; &ldquo;You can lock up against a thief and
rogue, but you can&rsquo;t a liar.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Some nights he would be a bit silent and moody.
One thing would always arouse him and we boys, like all boys, loved to
rouse him and as we whispered to one another:</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;ll get him going!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Who
shot the pig because it wouldn&rsquo;t go to sleep on the perch with the
hens.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I never did,&rdquo; Moffey would say, as we kids started tittering. &ldquo;It was like this...."</p>
