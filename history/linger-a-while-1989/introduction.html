<p>As a child in the school classroom, I loved Friday afternoons –
  singing and storytelling sessions were my most enjoyable school hours.
These stories I have told to many, to be often told by them that I should write a book:</p>

<p>“It’s a way of life now gone.”</p>

<p>“Get it down on paper.”</p>

<p>So, with my pen in hand, Dear Reader, I take you back to my
childhood – the 1920’s – and share with you my little band of friends
and acquaintances that I have portrayed now in this book. My stories
of scenes, incidents and impressions of an age that’s gone, never to
return.</p>

<p>So walk with me through our village, down
memory lane........</p>
