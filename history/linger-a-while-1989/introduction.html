<h2 id="TOC-INTRODUCTION">INTRODUCTION</h2>

<p>As a child in the school classroom, I loved Friday afternoons &ndash;
  singing and storytelling sessions were my most enjoyable school hours.
These stories I have told to many, to be often told by them that I should write a book:</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a way of life now gone.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Get it down on paper.&rdquo;</p>

<p>So, with my pen in hand, Dear Reader, I take you back to my
childhood &ndash; the 1920&rsquo;s &ndash; and share with you my little band of friends
and acquaintances that I have portrayed now in this book. My stories
of scenes, incidents and impressions of an age that&rsquo;s gone, never to
return.</p>

<p>So walk with me through our village, down
memory lane........</p>
