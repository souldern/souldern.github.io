<p>Juniper Jack was the last real pedlar to come walking through
our villages, selling his wares at the doors of our village cottages.</p>
<p>A big man, six foot or more, fresh faced, with a neat beard.
Slung over his shoulder, a large type of fisherman’s hamper, all
sorts of haber­dashery all stacked neatly, cottons, needles, pins,
studs, etc. and rows of ribbons and bows, in many colours.</p>
<p>How the family crowded around him on doorsteps. His visit was
an event to be looked forward to, enjoy, and to talk about after­wards.
My mum’s going to buy me a ribbon, or a bow, or slide if I
do my tasks, or messages, when Juniper Jack comes. Sometimes she
did, but sometimes, the money didn’t run to it, and “Well next time
she will.”</p>
<p>These people very rarely went out of the village. At most to
the next village. As Jack got older his steps got smaller, his visits
less frequent. The carrier cart had made way for the bus and people
went to town and bought their own. Jack got slower, and was glad of
a lift, with the baker, butcher, or grocer as they delivered around
the villages. Always polite and chatty. On dropping off at his
nearest point, he would thank you for the lift, with a few words, such
as “If you get to the next stile first, put a stone on it. If I get
there first, I’ll knock it off.” We never worked that one out.
Jack faded away early 1930’s.</p>
