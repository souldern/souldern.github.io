time after the Conquest Jordan de Sai gave the Church of Sulethorne to
the Abbey of Eynsham, or Ensham, in the following
terms:―“I, Jordan de Sai, for the soul of my son William,
on the day in which I have committed him to the tomb at Egnesham, have
given up to to the said monastery the Church of Sulethorn.” The
witnesses are “Ranulph my son” and others. (From a
Chartulary of Ensham, Cotton MS., Claudius A. VIII. fol. 135, in the
British Museum).  This gift was confirmed by Hugh, Bishop of Lincoln,
who also confirmed a pension of two marks of silver† yearly from the
Church of Sulethorn. In 1218 William de Warres, nephew of Robert,
Abbot of Eynsham, was admitted to the vicarage, when the monks had got
their pension up to 100 shillings. Somewhat later, Robert de Hay,
rector of Sulthorn, claimed from Oseney Abbey a certain measure of
corn for their demesne lands in Mixberie, and fourpence yearly of
their demesne lands at Fulwell, by virtue of an old custom called
“Church Scot.” However, by consent of the Abbot and Convent
of Eynsham, patrons of the said Church of Sulthorne, the said rector agreed to an annual
pension of five shillings in full satisfaction for the said corn and
money. (MS. Osn. Reg., fol. 121.)</p>

<p>† A mark of silver, 13s. 4d.</p>
</div>
<p>In 1233 there is the following notice:―“To all sons of
our Holy Mother the Church, to whom the present writ shall come, the
Priors of St. John and St. James send greeting,” and recite a
mandate from Pope Gregory, wherein it is stated that the Prior and
Convent of St. Frideswide, of Oxford, have by a plaint shown that
Robert of Sulthorn, Nicholas of Beckell, a trusty knight, and divers
others, do, in the matter of tithes and holdings, wrong the said Prior
and Convent, and further that his Holiness has 
ordered the Dean of Northampton and the Priors of St. John
and St. James, or any two of them, to summon the parties before
them, and decide the question at issue without appeal. Further
reciting that, upon parties being so summoned, Robert, rector of
Sulthorn, confessed in court that the tithes of one hide of land,
which is called the “Hide of Sulthorne,” is within the bounds of the
parish of Frettewelle, and so by common right belonging to the Church
thereof, and by the same right to the Canons of
St. Frideswide. Whereupon it was adjudicated that the said tithes
should belong to the said Prior of Frideswide, and be alienated from
the said Robert and his Church of Sulthorn for ever. The priest of
Sulthorn renewed this suit the following year, and the Pope appointed
three more commissioners, other than those before mentioned. These
confirmed the former sentence, but the priest appealed to Rome again,
and ultimately won his cause, subject to a yearly payment of 10
shillings to the Priory.* “The rector of the Church of Sulthorne
holds (by the same fee) one hide of land which was formerly given to
the Church of Sulthorne in perpetual alms.”―(Testa de Nevill.)</p>
<p>
In 1291 John de Bernewelle, parson of the Church of Sulthorn, had
recovered his seisin against Thomas de Lewknore and Lucy, his wife,
of his common of pasture in Sulthorn, belonging to his
freehold.―<i>(Abbreviatio Rotulomm originalium, Ed. I.)</i> And in 1297 the
same John de Bernewelle has a letter of protection against further
taxation by patent dated 2nd March of that year.† Also in the
<i>Abbreviatio Rotulorum</i> it is stated that the Rector, Adam de Kereseye,
had recovered his seizsin in the King's Court at Oxford, against Lucy,
who had been wife of Thomas de Lewknore, of 40s. rent in Sulthorn,
and in the <i>Testa de Nevill</i>, temp. Henry III. and Ed. I.
it is said that Lucia de Arderne holds the whole village as her
free marriage dowry.</p>
<div class="footnote">
<p>* A great portion of the glebe, now called “Inlands Farm,” is in the parish
of Fritwell.</p>
<p>† <i>In Post mortem Inq.</i>,22nd Ed. 1., “Joh'es do
Bernewelle, Sulthorne Villa, de cursu aquae divertendo ibidem.”</p>
</div>
<p>
In the 33rd of Ed. I. (1305) there are the following pleadings before
Ralph de Hengham and his fellow justices of the bench of our Lord the
King, in Trinity Term:―Thomas, Abbot of Egnesham, by his attorney,
appeared against Lucia, wife of Thomas de Lewk­nore and against Peter
of Schevyndon, to hear an assize of <i>darrein presentment</i>,
of which the said Thomas did here in the court arraign the assize
(that is, bring the cause into court) against them, about the advowson
of the Church of Soulthorn, which is vacant. The report goes on to
state that the said Lucia and Peter defended the suit against the
said abbot, but not appearing, judgement was claimed by him upon their
default. The jury find that the vacancy occurred upon the death of one
John de BerneweIle, and those who have been consulted upon the rights
of the abbot affirm that in the 20th Henry III. (1236) an agreement
was made
between Nicholas, then Abbot of Egnesham, and one Lucia de Arderne
(grandmother of Lucia de Lewknore), by which she acknowledged that the
advowson belonged to the aforesaid Abbey of Egnesham, and that when a
vacancy in the office of abbot happened, the Bishop of Lincoln, as
patron of the said office, did confer the Church on Geoffrey de
Stokes, one of his clergy. And those who have been consulted about
collusion between the parties as to the value of the Church, find
there was no collusion―that the Church is of the value of 20 marks
yearly, and that the period of six months for presentment has not
elapsed. Therefore, it was allowed that the aforesaid Abbot Thomas
should have a writ to the Bishop of Lincoln, and that upon its
presentation he (the Bishop) should admit a fit person to the
aforesaid Church, and the Abbot was allowed 10 marks from the
defendant in compensation for his losses.*
</p>
<p>We hear of no further
lawsuits after this, only of the constant change of the clergy in the
earlier centuries, as will be seen from the following list, and
which may probably be accounted for by the alienation of the tithes to
Eynsham Abbey.</p>
