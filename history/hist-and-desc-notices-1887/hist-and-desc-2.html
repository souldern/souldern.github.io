 etymology of ‘Souldern’ is a subject of much speculation.  The
earliest record we have upon the subject, and this was written
subsequently to the Norman Conquest, renders the name as ‘Sul-thorne.’
It is evident that this name is of Saxon origin, as no Norman scribe
could have corrupted any anterior name into ‘thorne’ as the <i>th</i> was
unknown to the Norman vocabulary, except in such Saxon expressions as
‘thane,’ ‘theft-book,’ &amp;c. About two-thirds of the Saxon
place-names are composed of two elements, each member being a noun,
although the first is used as an adjective. This is in accordance with
the genius both of the Saxon and English languages. The word
<i>grass-field</i>, for instance, will serve as an example. The
question then arises a, to the relationship the component parts bear
to each other. ‘Sul,’ besides signifying ‘a plough,’ denoted
‘plough-land,’ as may be seen from the Saxon word ‘Sul-uicle,’ a
small portion of plough-land―‘uicle,’ a little piece of
anything. ‘Thorn’ might have denoted a brake of thorns;
Dorn-burg in Germany corresponding to Thornbury in England. Ainsworth in his
Dictionary gives ‘Sul’ as a current English word in the last century
for a plough, although it is used now only locally. It is perhaps derived
from ‘Sulcare,’ to plough or furrow."*</p>
<p>Another contributor to these “Notes,” to whom we are
also much indebted, writes―“the name of Souldern, I think, is
probably derived from ‘Sulod,’ or sylod, ‘acru,’ a
<i>ploughed place:</i>
exactly corresponding to the name given to the supposed <i>tumulus</i> (?)
“Ploughley Hill.” Whilst the Rural Dean, the Rev. J. C.
Blomfield, has suggested the derivation from
“Sel”-thorn, “the great thorn,” as distinguishing
it from Blackthorn and Highthorn, two places in the
neighbourhood, and also in the line of the Portway.</p>
<p>
The name appears in all public
documents until 1469 as Sulthorn, with rare and very occasional
variations of Suldren or Sul­phorne, <i>ph</i> being a mis-reading for the
A.S. <i>th</i>.</p>

The present village is in the Hundred of Ploughley, Deanery, Union,
and County Court District of Bicester, in the Diocese and County of
Oxford. It is bounded on the N. by Aynho (Northamptonshire), on the
W. by the Cherwell, on the E. by Fritwell, and on the S. and S.W. by
Fritwell and Somerton. The elevation of the high ground above Souldern
is a little over 500 feet above the sea.</p>
<p> *“Souldern is mostly situated upon the lower beds of the
Great Oolite. Below this, on the slope at the eastern end of tho
village, the ferruginous sandy beds of the <i>Inferior Oolite</i> crop
out. These surround the village in the form of a ring, a quarter of a
mile wide. Exterior to this, and on still lower ground, the clays of
the <i>Upper Lias</i> make an outer broken ring of about the same
width, open to the east; one limb turning south towards Ploughley
Hill. Above, towards the old tollgate, the <i>lower</i> beds of the
<i>Great Oolite</i> again come in; and are well shown in the old
quarries in Mr. Crook's field, where a good section of the flags and
shells may be seen. In the “Memoir of the Geological Survey of Great
Britain,” to accompany map 45, a drawing of this section is given,
showing—</p>
<blockquote style="text-indent:0em;font-style:normal">
1—Vegetable soil resting on a band of clay.<br />
2—Rubble. <br />
3—White Marl. <br />
4—Freestone.
</blockquote>
<p>
 The stone is strongly jointed and dips 4° to S.E. Many fossils may
be seen; and Mr. Crook has some .fine slabs with <i>fucoids</i> from this
place. Numerous species from somewhat higher beds are scattered 
about the field to the S.W. On the north side of the road leading
to the Tower Farm, just within the allotment ground, a quarry,
now apparently disused, shows the same beds dipping strongly to
the north. A third of a mile to the N.E. there is another quarry
with higher beds showing the commencement of a roll which
once carried the continuation of these beds over there about the
tollgate. The white limestones have been largely quarried about
here for building purposes and road stone, and are still used for
these purposes. The country between Souldern and Aynho is much
broken by ‘faults;’ two cross Aynho Park from N.E. to S. W.,
the more southerly one coinciding with the county boundary;
another runs from ‘Inland's Farm,’ skirts the village on the N.E.,
and is lost in the last-mentioned fault. They complicate the
surface-geology, though the displacements are not very considerable.
The following fossils were collected from the Great Oolite beds two
years ago:—</p>

The area is 2270 acres. The population (1887) is about 500. In 1879
there were 117 houses and 498 inhahitants: of these 262 were members
of the Church of England, 63 “Exclusive Methodists,” 66 attended
Church and Chapel indiscriminately, 39 Where Roman Catholics, and 62
ignored every form of religion. There are the Church, a Roman Catholic
Chapel, and a Wesleyan Meeting House, in the village. The Rector, the
Rev. Dr. Stephenson, states that before the opening of the Oxford and
Birmingham Canal, which runs through the parish, the inhabitants of
Souldern only numbered 160 to 200 souls. The nearest point whence
coals could be obtained was from the adjoining county of Bucks, and it
was almost impossible for the poor to get any fuel. The Canal having
removed this difficulty, numerous families of labourers settled in
the place, and in a few years the population more than doubled.</p>
<p>Souldern is 16 miles from Oxford, 3 from Deddington, 8 from
Banbury, and 7 from Brackley and Bicester. The nearest Station is
Aynho on the Great Western line, within 4 miles distance.  From the
want of capital or of energy, or more probably of both, on the part of
the inhabitants, no successful attempt has been made to obtain a more
direct route. The modern <i>town</i> is pleasantly situated on the
outskirts of Aynho Park, and slopes down so abruptly from the turnpike
house (well known to members of the Bicester Hunt as Souldern Gate)
that little of it can be seen from the high road. After the short and
abrupt descent to the town­well, whence a road branches off to the
Church and Rectory, the village extends upwards and onwards in a
westerly direction until it ends in the Manor House belonging to
Col. Cox, which stands on the brow of the hill overlooking the valley
of the Cherwell.
In the main street are several
substantial looking houses, built of the white stone of the
neighbourhood; thatched cottages with apricot trees on most of the
walls; and two Elizabethan buildings, occupied respectively by
Mr. Thomas Merry and John Boddington. About 1851 Mr. James Minn gave a
piece of land and 2 cottages adjoining, for the accommodation of
school-teachers. Since the recent Education Act the school has been
much altered and enlarged, a good house has been erected in place of
the cottages, and a clock has recently been put up. Mr. and
Mrs. Tingey (1887) are the present worthy master and mistress.</p>
<p>The supply of water in Souldern is abundant. A never failing
stream rises in a field called “Bove-well,” which after
supplying the town pond, passes the Rectory, and finally finds its way
into the county brook, which divides Oxfordshire from
Northamptonshire. Prior to the enclosure of 1856–7 there was another
spring in that part of the common land called “Chadwell,”
where the water was collected in a stone tank dedicated to St. Chad;
unfortunately this well is now stopped up.</p>
<p> The population is chiefly agricultural. Until recently nearly
every cottager had her lace pillow, but modern education has closed
the doors of the three schools formerly devoted to the teaching of
this industry in the parish. Souldern could at one time boast of its
three crosses; but during the period of miserable Vandalism which
succeeded the Reformation, and reached its height at the Great
Rebellion, these were almost entirely destroyed. The steps and base of
one, however, may still be seen in the churchyard; the base of another
only, called Cole's Cross, in Col. Cox's field (see Charities); but of
the third not a vestige is left. There are no remains of Butts in the
parish, though probably these at one time existed, as by an ordinance
of the 5th year of Edward IV, it was required that “Butts should
be made in every township, at which the inhabitants were to shoot up
and down upon all feast days, under the penalty of a half-penny for
every time anyone of them neglected to perform this exercise.”
We are inclined to think that the Butts at Souldern were placed where
the bowling-green was afterwards established. Remains of the latter
are to be traced on the right hand side of the road leading from the
village to old Souldern Gate. The remains of the stocks are also to be
seen at the corner near the Fox Inn.</p>
<p>
The only days now kept with special customs in the village are 14
Feb., 29 May, the Feast Day, and Christmas. On Valentine's Day the
children come round shouting—with outstretched hands, and laying great
accent on the last line of the distich—</p>
<blockquote style="text-indent:0em;font-style:normal">
 “Good morrow, Valentine!<br />
 I be yours and you be mine,<br />
 Plaze give us a Valentine.”
</blockquote>
<p>
May Day, although shorn of some of its glories by the intolerance of
the Puritans, is still May Day, for groups of children, dressed in
their Sunday best, go from door to door with their pretty and often
most tastefully arranged garlands, bright with kingcups and daisies
and all the bravery of spring flowers, chanting the following quaint
old ditty</p>
<blockquote style="text-indent:0em;font-style:normal">
<p>
 “Gentlemen and Ladies,<br />
   We wish you happy May,<br />
 We come to show our May Garland<br />
   Because it is May Day.<br />
     <i>Chorus</i>—Because it is May Day, &amp;c.</p>
<p>
 A branch of May we bring to you<br />
   And at your door it stands,<br />
 It is but a sprig, but it prospers a bough,<br />
  The work of our LORD'S hands.<br />
    <i>Chorus</i>—Gentlemen and ladies,” &amp;c.,<br />
        <i>repeat 1st Verse.</i>
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
On the 29th of May, the anniversary of the restoration of King Charles
II., a large branch of oak is displayed in the principal street, and
oak apples are extensively worn. On this day also the annual meeting
of the Souldern Club or Friendly Society is held. This Club was
originally established in 1816, but has been worked under a new system
with great success for the last few years. There are at present
(1886) 84 actual members who pay an admis­sion fee of 5s., and 4s. per
quarter, and 12 honorary members, who subscribe from 10s. to one
guinea per annum. Michael Blencowe and Jesse Lake are the stewards,
and James Tingey treasurer and secretary; trustees, Messrs. Hill and
Welford. The allowance during illness is nine shillings per week for
one year, and half pay for any time of sickness afterwards. At the end
of every five years the surplus fund, with the exception of £1 per
head, is divided in proportion among the members. Those who have
received more than the amount in sick pay, forfeit all claim in the
division.</p>
<p>
The Village Feast or Wake is kept on the first Stmday after the 18th
of September. In all probability it was originally held on the first
Sunday after the 8th, that day being the anniversary of the Nativity
of the Blessed Virgin, to whom the Church is dedicated. We are told
that as late as the middle of the present century Souldern feast was
looked forward to from September to September. Open house was kept
from Saturday till Monday; rich plum puddings were made and joints of
beef cooked by all who could afford them, and the poorest cottage had
its cake and bottle of home-made wine. Relations and friends from all
parts flocked in, old friendships were renewed, and old differences
made up.</p>
<p>
The observance of the 5th of November has almost become a thing of the
past; a contemptible bonfire just serves the purpose of collecting a
few roughs.</p>
<p> Christmas is still kept up in somewhat of the olden style; carol
singers and mummers come round to all the houses for more than a week
beforehand. These mummers are said to be the representa­tives of
the secular players, of whom John of Salisbury wrote in the 12th
century that “their plays had little to do with morality
 . . .  they consisted of comic tales, dialogues
and stories, to which were added coarse and indecent jests.” Whether
this description were true or not, it is an undoubted fact that
mummers were welcome Christmas visitors in the halls and castles of
England, and that the pieces performed by them were of a secular
character as dislinguished from the miracle and mystery plays of the
monks. What the plot of the modern performances may be we are at a
loss to say, but as far as we can gather old John of Salisbury's
description still holds good. There is a female called “Molly,” always
represented by the biggest young man who can be found; a fight in
which some-one is killed, and the doctor comes in on his hobbyhorse to
bring the deceased to life. Then “Molly” has the toothache and the
doctor operates on her, and extracts a tooth the size of a decanter
stopper. His man “Jack” is in active attendance, and the Clown or
Jack-pudding introduces himself in the following terms—</p>
<blockquote style="text-indent:0em;font-style:normal">
“Ear comes as never come yet,<br />
With my gret yead, and my little wit;<br />
My yead is gret, my wit is small,<br />
I'll do my, dooty to plaze you all.”
</blockquote>
<p>
As to costumes, the actors appear to have robbed every scarecrow in
the parish; and as to thee play, it is difficult to say which is most
to be wondered at—its intense stupidity or extreme vulgarity.</p>
<p>
The greater part of the following biography was communicated to the
late Mr. W. Wing, and may be foulld in his excellent work,
“Annals of the Bicester Union.” Of Souldern worthies there
are no records extant. The only individual of whom any notice remains
is one Daniel Brown, surnamed ‘Belcher,’ a poor half-silly
creature, the butt of the village, who is said to have performed many
eccentric feats, among others that of riding on the back of a bull
into the town pond. Being strictly honest he was often employed as a
messenger, and at other times amused himself by wandering about the
country. On one occasion he found his way as far as London, and
feeling somewhat hungry after the long journey, he invested his
<i>all</i> in the purchase of a lemon. This having failed to satisfy
the cravings of hunger, and being too proud to beg, he found himself
in Cheapside in a state of complete desti­tution. Fortunately
Mr. Cartwright's carriage was passing at the time, Belcher hailed the
coachman with delight, and although our hero looked anything but a
creditable acquaintance, the man acted the part of a good Samaritan,
took him to his own lodgings, gave him a meal, and sent him back to
his native village by the next waggon with this ticket on his back,
“Belcher Brown—Souldern Town—pass him on.”
Whether he again visited the metropolis is not known; we hear nothing
more of him but his will, which runs as follows—
</p>

“My soul I leave unto the Lord<br />
  My body to the ground;<br />
My 'bacca box to Master Ned,<br />
  My clothes back to the Town.<br />
Unto my old friend Shepherdless (<i>sic</i>)<br />
  To him I leave my knige;<br />
I think it best to make my will<br />
  Whilst I have strength and life;<br />
But if the Shepherd should be dead,<br />
  My knife goes back to Master Ned.”


<p>The Master Ned here referred to was one of the Clifford family, who
had evidently shown Belcher some kindness. This document (the will)
and the 'bacca box are ill the possession of the present
Mr. Clifford.*</p>

<p> * The following anecdote has been related to us of another
Souldern man. Having gone up in 1861 to London to see the Great
Exhibition, he was, when inside the Palace. naturally enough, staring
and gazing about him. when suddenly a fair specimen of the Yankee
hailed him with “Wal, stranger, what are you looking for?”
The Souldern man was equal to the oocasion, for he answered without
hesitation, “Well. I was looking for a bigger fool than myself,
