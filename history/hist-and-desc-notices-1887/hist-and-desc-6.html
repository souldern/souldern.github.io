<p>Thomas Dodwell, of Souldern, by indentures dated 17th and 18th
August, 1694, conveyed 3½ acres of meadow grounds lying in
Souldern, upon trust, for payment to the Overseers and Churchwardens
for the time being, of the sum of 30s.  yearly, to be laid out in the
clothing of such two of the poor inhabitants of Souldern as the major
part of the landowners of Souldern, being Protestants, and having the
quantity of a quarter of a yardland or more within the parish, should,
from time to time, nominate and appoint, and to no other use or
purpose whatever. In 1826, when the report of the Charity
Commissioners was made, the sum of £1 10s. was annually paid by Mr.
John Merry, the owner of the premises charged, and laid out by the
Overseers in cloth, which was given at a Vestry among five or six poor
and industrious Protestants not receiving parish relief. In the years
1824–25 three men and three women received a sufficient quantity of
cloth to make them a jacket or petticoat. The oldest resident
parishioners, being married persons, receive it in succession.</p>

<p> The same Thomas Dodwell, also by deed, dated
18th August, 1694, and 12th March, 1699, conveyed two closes in this
parish, containing, by estimation, 20 acres, called the
“Millsedges,” and a small close called “Little
Millsedge,” upon trust, for distribution weekly on Sunday in the
forenoon, in the Parish Church of Souldern, to four poor persons,
inhabitants of Souldern, to be from time to time nominated by the
major part of the freeholders, qualified as in the preceding case, of
one threepenny loaf of baker's bread apiece. In 1826 the above
premises were the property of Will Minn, of Souldern, and he supplied
the four threepenny loaves a week-given at the Church on Sunday
morning, to four poor widows of the parish, nominated by the Vestry as
any vacancies occurred.</p>

<p>
The sum of £2 3s. 4d. is paid annually by F. W. Cartwright, Esq., of
Aynho, the proprietor of land in Souldern, as part of a rent charge
of £9 19s.  4d., given to the poor of Aynho, Crowton, and Souldern,
for bread, by the will of Rich. Cartwright, dated 1st Feb., 1633.
With this sum of £2 3s. 4d., five eightpenny loaves are provided,
which are given by the Overseers in the Church, to five poor widows,
who are appointed in the same manner as those who receive Dodwell's
bread.</p>

Elizabeth Westcar, of Hill House, in the parish of Souldern, by will
dated 19th Feb., 1820, gave certain property for sale, upon trust, to
invest £400, part of the proceeds, and to layout one half of the
dividends in the purchase of clothing, and the other half in the
purchase of bread, for the poor of Souldern, to be given and
distributed, yearly, on Christmas Day, in such proportions as the
trustees should think fit; and in like manner to invest £200 for
payment of the dividends to the School Master for the time being of
the National School.  These legacies were laid out by the executors
in the purchase of what is now £544 8s. 6d.  four per cents.,
producing an annual dividend of £21 15s. 6d., which is distributed as
ordered.</p>
<p>
The actual receipts from the Souldern Charities in the year 1881
amounted to a little more than £47, and the accounts were fully
audited and approved by the Charity Commissioners.</p>

<p>
The following is a brief abstract of the account given in the report
of the Commissioners for Charities in 1826 :—</p>
<p> By a decree in Chancery, 29 June, 10 Jas. I. (1612), an assignment
was confirmed of 7 acres of land at Cole's Cross, 5 acres called
“The Green,“ and 1 acre called “The Pits” and
“Bowling Green,” for the use of the poor inhabitants of
Souldern, as also an annual payment of 5s.  from the Incumbent of the
parish for a piece of waste ground adjoining the Parsonage. Up to 1814
this land remained unenclosed, and was used by the villagers as common
grazing-ground, and was the subject of constant contention amongst the
poor. In that year a petition was presented in Chancery upon the
matter, and in 1815 Trustees were appointed; and the land at Cole's
Cross with part of the Green was leased to Rob. Kilbye Cox., Esq., for
99 years, from 7 May, 1819, at a yearly rent of £1, in consideration
of his paying the costs of the Chancery settlement, amounting to £236
7s. 6d. The annual value of this land was then estimated at £12.</p>
<p>
Upon the remaining portion of the Green and the Bowling Leys there
were in 1826 17 cottages built partly by the parish and partly by the
poor themselves, with gardens attached; and 40 gardens besides. Each
one who had a house and garden then paid yearly to the Trustees
1s. 6d., and each occupant of a garden alone, 1s.; but these
payments now vary considerably.</p>
<p>
The remainder of the land at the Bowling Green and the Pits,
amounting to about half an acre, was let in 1826 at a yearly rent of
£1 1s.</p>
<p>
The five shillings for the land adjoining the Parsonage is paid
yearly.</p>
<p>
All the rents (including some for the feeding of different lanes)
are distributed under the direction of the Vestry in various
proportions among all the poor of the parish, none being omitted.</p>
<p>
Certain lands in Souldern amounting to 26 acres are included among the
Charity Lands belonging to Bicester.</p>
