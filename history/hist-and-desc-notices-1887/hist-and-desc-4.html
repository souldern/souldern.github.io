<h3 id="TOC-THE-CHURCH.-">THE CHURCH.*</h3>
<p>
In Parker's <i>Eccles. &amp; Architect. Topography of Oxfordshire</i>, published
in 1850, is this description :―</p>
<p>
“Souldern, St. Mary, Chancel, Nave, with S. aisle and Tower. The
Chancel is modern, the Aisle windows are good early Decorated,† the
Nave has a clerestory and retains some ancient carved seats.‡ The
Tower is early Norman, having walls of great thickness. A cornice of
this Church is engraved in Rickman,
p. 163.”</p>
<p>
To this we may add that the Tower is very much out of the
perpendicular, as is also the massive western arch. The font, which
Mr. Parker does not notice, stands near the S. door, and is evidently
very ancient, of the simplest form, without any sculpture, and
large―but whether Saxon or Norman has not been determined. It has been
roughly used, and pieces, the size of a man's hand, have been knocked
out of it. The Tower contains five bells in all: four large bells,
and a small prayer-bell; the dates range from A.D. 1631 to 1635, and
one Bagle claims to be their maker, and has in­scribed his name as such
on each bell.</p>
<p style="text-indent:0em">
 1st Bell, or treble, “Cantate Domino Cantecum
Novum. Henry Bagle made me 1635.”<br />
2nd Bell (inscription illegible).<br />
3rd Bell, “Preservor (?) H.B. 1631 Cum voce jucundissima.”<br />
4th Bell, or Tenor, “Vobiscum cocrdo [concordo ?] Deum Laudare.”</p>
<p>
In September, 1877, the Church was inspected by Arthur Hodgson, Esq.,
of Bloxbam (architect), who made the following report :―</p>
<p>
“The Church of St. Mary, Souldern, is a very picturesque and
interesting structure. It is at the present time sadly in want of a
thorough restoration, and the Chancel is such a bad piece of modern
</p>
<div style="font-size:75%;border:solid thin black;margin-top:2em;margin-bottom:2em">
<p>
* Nearly the whole of the following notice is communicated by the
Rev. Dr. Rottan,
being abridged from a paper read by him before the members of our
Society in 1882.</p>
<p>† In one of these windows were these arms (Rawl.
MS. , B. 400 C.), “or, a lyon ramp.,
sab.―or, a cross engr, sab.―St. George's armes ―Gules, a castle or.”</p>
<p>‡ These seats were removed in 1855, when the Church was re-pewed.</p>
</div>
<p style="text-indent:0em">
work that it would be quite impossible to do anything but pull it
down, and build a new one of the same size as the original, and, if
possible, upon the old foundations―at the same time turning the line
old arch again to its proper use.* The Nave is parted from the
S. aisle by three pointed arches resting on round columns, the
capitals and bases of which are early Norman, and appear to have been
turned upside down. The N. and S. clerestory windows are very poor,
merely square openings. Some of the windows of the aisle are elaborate
and curious specimens of early Decorated work. The porch is also about
the same date, and there is a well moulded doorway, without capitals
to the jambs, and the labels terminate in heads leading from it into
the aisle.”</p>
<p>Since this report of Mr. Hodgson's there has been a most strenuous
effort, headed by the venerable Rector (Dr. Stephenson) and his
family, to carry out all the improvements it was possible to make. In
1878 a “faculty” was obtained to remove the hideous
gallery (partly erected in 1815, as a thank-offering) which blocked
out the Norman arch above mentioned and two of the best windows in the
aisle. The pillars and arches in the nave were scraped, the whole
building cleaned, and the church fittings and furniture greatly
improved by a series of gifts, up to the year 1883, which are entered
in the register, including altar table, brass desk, oak lectern,
service books, &amp;c. from Dr. Rotton, brass cross from
Mr. J. Cobbin, stained window-lights from the Rector, pulpit from
Fred. Stanton, Esq. and his wife, curtains, &amp;c.</p>
<p>The list of Vessels for the Holy Communion belonging to the church
in August, 1880, is as follows:―</p>
<p>I.―Silver Flagon, given Christmas Day, 1879, by J. H. Gough,
Frederick Stanton, and George Stratton, Esqs.</p>
<p>II.―Silver Paten (a thank-offering), 1880.</p>
<p>III.―Electro-plate cruet (Dr. Rotton).</p>
<p>
The original Holy Vessels, made of the white silver of former 
days, are―</p>
<p>I.―A Paten of 1634.</p>
<p>II.―A Chalice, dated 1654.</p>
<p>
“This,” as Dr. Rotton remarks, “is a standing historical witness of
the parish's loyalty, in a time of general disloyalty, to the ancient
faith and England's own old church.”</p>
<p>
The following is an inventory of church goods, etc., removed from the
church, in 6 Edw. VI., preserved amongst the records of the
Exchequer.</p>
<div style="font-size:75%;border:solid thin black;margin-top:2em;margin-bottom:2em">
<p>* This act of vandalism in dismantling the fair medieval Chancel,
destroying its arch and substituting the present monstrosity of a
characterless window, was perpetrated between the years 1772 and 1806,
during the incumbency of the Rev. John Horseman, B.D., Fellow of
St. John's, Cambridge, and Rector of Souldern for 34 years. The area
of the present Chancel is at least 8ft. less in length than
the original one, and its breadth has also been considerably
diminished.</p>
</div>
<p>
“This inventory indented made tbe 2nd day of May the 6th in year of
the reign of our Sovereign Lord King Edward the 6th, of all the goods,
plate, jewels, bells, and other ornaments pertaining to the parish
church of Souldern, in the County of Oxford, between Sir William
Reynolds, Knight, Thomas Breedy, and Thomas Cowsford, amongst others,
Commissioners appointed in the said County, for the survey of the said
goods with the premises, of the one part, and Thomas Bond and Thomas
Symes, of Souldern, aforesaid, of the other part: Witnesseth that all
the goods and other like premises hereafter written belonging to the
said. Church were committed by the said Commissioners to the custody
of Thomas Bond and Thomas Symes, with the sure undertaking that they
will at all times be forthcoming and to be answered:―</p>
<p style="text-indent:0em">
Imprimis. Three pair of vestments of satin of Bridges (Bruges)<br />
Item. Six pair of white vestments, on[e] satin of Bridges, and the
other white fustian.<br />
Item. One chalice of silver, parcel gilt.<br />
Item. Six copes of satin of Bridges.<br />
Item. Six candlesticks of brass.<br />
Item. One censer.<br />
Item. Six bells and a sanctus bell.”</p>
<p>
In an appeal to the public for funds towards the restoration of the
church, Dr. Rotton quoted the following lines from the “Miscellaneous
Sonnets” of Wordsworth, which were written during one of the poet's
visits to the Rectory as the guest of his College friend, the
Rev. Robert Jones, then Rector of the Parish:―</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:center;text-indent:0em">A Parsonage in Oxfordshire</p>
<p style="text-indent:0em;font-style:normal">
“Where holy ground begins, unhallowed ends,<br />
Is marked by no distinguishable line;<br />
The turf unites, the pathways intertwine,<br />
And whereso'er the stealing footstep tends,<br />
Garden, and that domain where kindred friends<br />
And neighbours rest together, here confound<br />
Their several features, mingled like the sound<br />
Of many waters, or as evening blends<br />
With shady night; soft airs from shrub and flower<br />
Waft fragrant greetings to each silent grave;<br />
And while these lofty poplars* gently wave<br />
Their tops, between them comes and goes a sky<br />
Bright as the glimpses of Eternity<br />
To saints accorded in their mortal hour.”
</p>
</blockquote>
<div style="font-size:75%;border:solid thin black;margin-top:2em;margin-bottom:2em">
<p>
* These poplars, which stood in a field now (1887) occupied by
Mr. Rigby, were cut down some years ago.</p>
</div>
<p>
When the above lines were written the Rectory garden came up
to the north side of the Church, and was only parted from the
churchyard by an invisible fence. A line of shrubs was afterwards 
put in which completely divided the two, but the grounds were
recently (1885) restored to their original condition by Dr. Rotton, 
to whom is also due the planting and adornment of God's Acre
with choice pines and flowering trees.</p>
<p>
The Rectory itself is a well-built amd picturesque looking gabled
house―said to be a good specimen of the Parsonage of days gone
by. From the appearance of the garden upon the north and.west side,
there must at one time have been good fish-ponds on the
premises.</p>
<p>
The only tombstones of any interest in the churchyard are the
following, of which notes have been made by Dr. Rotton in the Register
of 1667 :―</p>
<p>
Headstone:―Ann, daughter of John Neale and Catherine his wife, died
April 1, 1682. On the foot-stone:―“Kathern the wife of John Neale
lying buried with her daughter in her grave, departed this life the
laste day of April 1716 aged 75.”</p>
<p> On another headstone:―“Here lyes intered the body of John
the ever dutiful and obedient son of John and Catherine Neale who
departed this life the 11 day of July 1682 and in the yeare of his age 21.</p>
<p style="text-align:center">Pray doe not disturb his bones.”</p>
<p>Altar-tomb, about which Dr. Rotton writes:―“On the
morrow of St. Bartholomew, 1882, I refixed at my own cost the Neale
monument, which had sunk from soil subsidence, and on cleaning away
the gathering moss the following inscription appeared:―</p>
<blockquote style="text-indent:0em;font-style:normal">“In full and
certain hope of the second coming of Christ resteth
here the body of John Neale who departed this life the
7 day of June, 1662, and yeare of his age 51. Mary his 
beloved wife and widow lying buried within this grave
departed this life Aug. 4, 1705, in the yeare of her age 89.”
</blockquote>
<p>
Old men report a tradition that Neale made his own tomb with his own
hand. I believe his to be the oldest standing monument in the
churchyard.” On the tombstone are engraved the arms  of the Masons'
Company, granted by William Hancheston, Clarencieux King at Arms, in
the year 1474, incorporated by letters patent of 29 Charles II., 17
September, 1677.</p>
<p> Rawlinson says (in his MS. before referred to):―“In
the churchyard 2 tombs against ye wall; i., plain stone, inscribed in
front thus:―‘Here lyes interred the body of John King,
gent., who departed this life December 24th Anno Domini 1712, in the
year of his age 71.’ On the second thus:―“Here lyes interred the
body of Esther the wife of John King, who departed this life November
16 1709, in the yeare of her age 78.”</p>
<p>
Several members of the Hill family (see list of Churchwardens) are
buried on the south side of the churchyard.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><i>Monumental Inscriptions in the church.</i></p>
<p>
The following notices are all that remain of the BIGNELLS, who for

to record also the interment of Thomas, son of Thomas and Mary
Bignell, who died April 7th, 1796, aged 71 years, and of Sarah, his

<blockquote style="text-indent:0em;font-style:normal">
“Friend, here thou seest my body in earth,<br />
And how my life is now cut of by death;<br />
But know my soule is now at rest with Him<br />
Who from everlasting death did it redeem.<br />
T'will not be long before that thou must dye,<br />
And then in grave thyself will lye;<br />
Be wise now, therefore, while that thou hast tyme,<br />
That grace and CHRIST and glory may be thine.<br />
Thyself deceive not with a Christian name,<br />

<p>[The family of Reynolds, of Cassington, was founded by Edmund
Rainolds, a younger son of Richard Rainolds, of Pinhoe, or Pin­hawes,
near Exeter,* who purchased the estate at Cassington from the Coventry
family towards the end of the reign of Elizabeth. Of this Edmund,
Anthony à Wood remarks, “he was educated at Corpus
Chr. College, of which he was a Fellow, but leaving that house
because he was popishly affected, retired to Gloster Hall, where being
a noted tutor for 60 years or thereabouts, he grew very rich.” He
died November 21, 1630, aged 92, and was buried in the chancel of
Wolvercot. Edmund Rainolds left his estate at Cassington to his
nephew, William, who seems to have married Alice d of Thomas
Whitgreave, Esq., of Moseley, in Staffordshire, and by her was the
father of Alice Reynolds, who named Richard Kilbye, of
Souldern. Another of the Reynolds married a Penrose. It may be
remarked that a brother of Mr. Kilbye, named Francis, was at Moseley
as a pupil under Father Huddleston when Charles II. arrived there
after the battle of Worcester, and he assisted his uncle, Whitgreave
in sheltering the King, There is a very old house close to the Church
at Cassington which is still known as “Reynolds,” though it
is evidently only part of a larger building, The family has long since
disappeared from the place.] </p>

Here lyeth the body of Anne, or Annette, the wife of Robert Kilbye
(gent.), who died September 8th, 1754, aged 84 years. Here lieth the

Reformed and the Popish Religion in their turns.”</p>
</div>
<p>On a stone in the S. aisle is the following inscription :―</p>
<p>“Sacred to the memory of William James Minn, seaman, son of Robert
and Hannah Minn, of Shrewsbury, who perished at sea on the night of
the 19th ,June, 1849, in 30 deg. S.E. and 10'30 deg W.longitude, aged
18 years and 10 months, to the great grief of all who knew him.”<br />
And,</p>
<p>“To the memory of James Minn, soldier, brother of the
above-named Robert. He likewise died at sea on his voyage to Canada, in
the year 1831, aged 44 years. He served fourteen years in the
Hussars, under the Marquis of Anglesey, and two years in the
Peninsula, in the 3rd Regt. of Lancers, and had an honourable
discharge from both Regts. His first action was Corunna, his last
Waterloo.―“The sea shall give up her dead.”</p>
<p>William aud James Minn (mentioned at p. 9 in these <i>Notes</i> as a
benefactor to the School) are buried in the churchyard.</p>
<p>ROUSBY.―James Henry, son of James Edwards Rousby, Esq., and
Caroline, his wife. He died 18th October, aged 5 years.</p>

Rev. Dr. Stephenson).</p>
<p>THROOKMORTON.―In the Chancel is a brass bearing
a heart supported by two hands, with three scrolls issuing from the
heart. The following words are written on the scrolls:―“Credo
quod Redemtor meus vivit et in novissimo die de tra surrectur' su et
in carne mea videbo Deu Salvatore meu.” Inscribed upon the heart
are the words, “Ihu mcy,”―and below the brass―“Here
lyeth buryed John Throckmorton, the sonne of Heugh Throckmorton
(gent.) and Elizabeth his wife, who dyed 6 day of Oct. in the yere of
our Lord, 1573.”*</p>
<div style="font-size:75%;border:solid thin black;margin-top:2em;margin-bottom:2em">
<p>* With reference to this interesting brass, we have been favoured
 with the copy of a letter from the Rev. Henry Burgess to Dr. Rotton,
 in which it is said that “Hearts are usual on brassses before
 the Reformation, and held in hands. They are Sometimes inscribed with
 “Mercy” or “Jesu Mercy,” (as at Souldern.)
 Tho passage from Job xix., 25 26, is frequently found in connection
 with the heart, the latter being insccribed “Credo,” and
 the scrolls, three in number, continuing the text, Sometimes the
 heart is held by two hands issuing from clouds (as at Souldern
 also). It is said that such memorials indicate that the deceased was
 enabled to perform a vow which he had made, but better still, I
 think, they are intended to embody the ancient invitatory
 “Sursum corda,” and to express a firm trust in the
 promises of God. I am also told that the heart was often
 interred in a different church from that in which the body was
 buried.” The attention of the present Sir Nicbolas Will
 Throckmorton having been called, in 1881, to the dilapidated state of
 this interesting family memorial, by the Rev. Dr. Rotton, he at once
 caused it to be restored.</p>
<p>
Another brass, also in the chancel, brears the effigy of a girl of
apparently 16 or 17 years of age. This has been recently (1882)
cleaned and replaced at the expense, and by the direction, of
Dr. Rotton.</p>
</div>
<p>WEEDON.―It will be seen hereafter that the Weedons purchased
the manor of Souldern from the descendants of the Throckmortons and
bequeathed the same to Samuel Cox in 1710. The following members of
the Weedon family were buried in the body of the
Church:―-Bernard Weedon, Esq., 1679; Ignatius Weedon, 1683; Mary
Weedon, widow of Bernard Weedon, Oct. 17th, 1691.―(Rawl. MS. B. 400);
Frances Weedon, wife of John Weedon, Esq., 1701. The said John
Weedon, 1702; Elizabeth, wife of Bernard Weedon, jun., 1708; John
Weedon, Esq., 1710; Bernard Weedon, 1713; Mary Weedon, 1728; William
Weedon, 1741 ; and Widow Weedon, 1744.</p>
<p>Nearly all the Weedons seem to have been Roman Catholics. Their
monuments may still be seen near the N. door. One of them has the
Weedon arms, carved as an escutcheon empaled with the arms of the
wife. There is another stone, on the other side of the church, with
the names of Weedon and Gough upon it.</p>
<p>WESTCAR.―The Westcars are mentioned further on in these <i>Notes</i>
as being benefactors of the Parish. Of this family the following are
buried in the church:―Samuel, died May 11 th, 1793, aged 33;
Thomas, died March 1st, 1809, aged 53; Mary, died June 20th, 1793,
aged 35; Elizabeth. died March 31st, 1820, aged 65; children of
Thomas Westcar (gent.) and Elizabeth his wife. Thomas Westear (gent.),
died September 27th, 1788, aged 72; Elizabeth, his wife, died August
10th, 1805, aged 88.*</p>
<p>The Rectors are buried in the Chancel. The first in date is
commemorated on a brass, recently restored by Dr. Rotton. “Of
your charitie py for the soul of Maister Thom[a]s Warne, late person
of this Church, which decesed XI die Aprilis, anno M°vcxiiij°.”
There is a full length effigy of the priest in his vestments on this
slab.</p>
<p><i>Hardinge.</i>―“Here lies
interred the body of the learned and reverend Thomas Hardinge,
Batchelour of Divinity, sometyme one of the Masters Of Westminster
School ; commonly called the Grecian, for his excellency in that
tongue; Rector of Soulderne 26 years, and author of the great
Ecclesiastical Historie†. His better monument he erected himself
where his memorie and his successors live together, in the faire
parsonage house, where he was not only eminent for his holy and pious
conversation but for his hospitality and charitie to the poore. His
epitaph is legible in the large volumes of his works. He suffered his
mortal change October 10th, 1648, in the tyme of the great Revolution
and change of Church and State: Living and dying himself in the same
constancy of obedience, a true sonne of the Church and professor
of the auncient Catholique faith.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;font-style:italic">THE REV. GEOFFREY SHAW </p>
<p>
The following account of an apparition alleged to have been seen by
him is found in Nichol's <i>Illustrations of Lit. Hist. of the 18th
cent.</i>, 1822, IV., 119.</p>
<p>
Part of a letter from Mr. Edward Walter, Fellow of St. John's College,
Camb., to a friend in the country; dated Dec. 6th, 1706:—</p>
<p>“I should scarce have
mentioned anything of the matter on my own account, but since you have
given yourself the trouble of an enquiry, I am, I think, obliged in
friendship to relate all that I know of the matter, and that I do the
more willingly because I can so soon produce my authority.</p>
<p>“Mr. Shaw, to whom the apparition appeared,
was Rector of Soldern, or Souldern, in Oxfordsbire, late of St. John's
College, [Cambridge], aforesaid, on whom Mr. Grove, his old
fellow-colle­giate, called July last, in his journey to the west, where
he staid a day or two and promised to see him again in his return,
which he did, and staid three days with him. In that time, one night
after supper, Mr. Shaw told him that there happened a passage which he
could not conceal from him, as being an intimate friend, and one to
whom this transaction might have something more relation to than
another man. He proceeded therefore and told him that about a week
before that time, viz., July 28th, 1706, as he was smoking and reading
in his study, about 11 or 12 at night, there came to him the
apparition of Mr. Naylor, formerly fellow of the said College and dead
some years ago, a friend of Mr. Shaw's, in the same garb he used to be
in, with his hands clasped before him. Mr. Shaw, not being much
surprized, asked him how he did, and desired him to sit down, which
Mr. Naylor did. They both sat there a considerable time, and
entertained one another with various discourses. Mr. Shaw then asked
after what manner they lived in the separate state? He answered,
“Far different from what they do here, but that he was very
well.” He enquired farther whether there was any of their old
acquaintance in that place where he was? He answered, “No! not
one;” and then proceeded and told him that one of their old
friends, naming Mr. Orchard, should die quickly, and that he himself
(Mr. Shaw) should not be long after. There was mention of several
people's names, but who they were or upon what occasion Mr. Grove
cannot or will not tell. Mr. Shaw then asked him whether he would not
visit him again before that time. He answered, no, he could not; he
had but three days allowed him, and farther he could not go. Mr. Shaw
said, “Fiat voluntas Domini,” and the apparition left
him.</p>
<p>
This is word for word as Mr. Shaw told Mr. Grove, and Mr. Grove told me.</p>
<p>
What surprized Mr. Grove was, that as he had, in his journey
homewards, occasion to ride through Clopton or Claxton, he called upon
Mr. Clark, fellow of our College aforesaid, and curate there, when
enquiring after College news, Mr. Clark told him Arthur Orchard* died
that week, August 6th, 1706, which very much shocked Mr. Grove, and
brought to his mind the story of Mr. Shaw afresh. About three weeks
ago Mr. Shaw died of an apoplexy, in the desk, of the same distemper
poor Arthur Orchard died of. Since this strange completion of matters
Mr. Grove has told this relation, and stands to the truth of it, and
that which confirms the narrative is, that he told the same to
Dr. Baldiston, the present Vice-Chancellor, and Master of Emanuel
College, above a week before Mr. Shaw's death, and when he came to the
College he was no way surprized as others were. What farthers my
belief of its being a true vision, and not a dream, is Mr. Grove's
incredulity of stories of this nature. Considering them both as men of
learning and integrity, the one would not first have declared nor the
other have spread the same were not the matter itself serious and
real.—Yours etc., EDWARD WALTER.”</p>
<p>There is also another letter, from “the
Rev. J. Hughes to the Rev. Mr. Borariker,” virtually giving the
same narrative And in an extract from a letter “from the Rev. Mr
Turner to Mr. Bonwicke,” we read:—“There is a circumstance
relating to the story of this apparition which adds great confirmation
to it. There is one, Mr. Cartwright, a member of Parliament, a man of
good credit and integrity, an intimate friend of Mr. Shaw's, who told
the same story with Dr. Grove's (which he had from Mr. Shaw at the
Archbishop of Canterbury's table), but he says further that Mr. Shaw
told him of some great revolutions in the State, which he will not
discover, being either obliged to silence by Mr. Shaw, or concealing
upon some prudent and politic reasons.” These letters are dated
November, 1706, and MSS. copies are in the possession of the writers
of these <i>Notes</i>.†</p>

<p> † For possesion of a scarce tract entitled, “Sermon
by William Offley on the death of the Rev. Geffrey Shaw, Rector of
Soulderne, Oxfordshire, who died whilst he was in the Church at
evening prayer,” 4to. (1707), the compilers are indebted to the
kindness of Mr. Madan. The Mr. Naylor, Vicar of Enstone, spoken of in
this narrative, is mentioned in Jordan's “History of
Enstone,” pp. 191 192, where we learn that he died in 1704, and
was buried July 1st of the same year. “Affidavit (of his being
buried in woo'len) was made before Mr. Brideoake, Rector of
Swerford. On a corner buttress of the church porch there is a small
diamond-shaped white marble slab to his memory,” bearing an
inscription of which the following is a translation:—“Near
this spot is deposited John Naylor, Master of Arts, Fellow of
University College, and Vicar of this Church. He died June 29th,
A.D. 1701, in the 49th year of his age, grievously dispirited
(<i>abjectus</i>) in the house of the Lord.”
