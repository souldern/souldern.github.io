<p>
About 1066, Jordan de Sai (whose name appears on the roll of Battle
Abbey) appears to have obtained a grant of the manor of “Sulethorn.”</p>
<p>
39 Hen. III., 1254–5.—“Sulthorn.  Dominus Radulphus de Erderne tenet
man.  de Sulthorn de honore Castelli Ricardi, quod Will. de
Stotewile tenet per servicium dimidii militis: libertatem habet, set
nescimus quo waranto, nisi quod vicecomes recipit quatuor solidos
de visu.  De aliis capitulis nil sciunt, nisi
defalt. dom. Radulphi.—<i>Rotuli Hundredorum</i> 1818, vol. II., p. 44.</p>
<p>
In 1261, or earlier, Philip Basset sold the said manor to Ralph de
Bray for 40 marks of silver.—(White Kennett's <i>Parochial Antiquities</i>,
Vol. I., p. 387).</p>
<p> Edw. I.—Thomas de Lewknore* holds the manor of Sulthurne of
Thomas de Arderne by the service of one pound of cummin yearly, and
the said Thomas holds from the heirs of Say, and it is a manor free in
itself, and has a view of frank pledge from the first Conquest of
England, and the bailiffs of our lord the King have no entrance unless
by writs of our lord the King.  And it has an ancient warren from the
first conquest of England.  And the sheriff of Oxford has 4s.  yearly
from the time of John de Tywe formerly sheriff of Oxford, who levied
those four shillings un&shy;justly.  And it has a right to waifs
(<i>wayvium</i>) from the Conquest aforesaid. And he holds in his lordship
three carucates of land and the meadow and pasture adjoining, and he
has there a free fishery, from the head of the meadow of Goldenham, as
far as the meadow of Fretewelle. And the said lord of Sulthurne at
his will, or his attorney, shall come to the two Great Hundred Courts
yearly to demand the liberty of his men belonging to the manor, and by
this they shall be free and at liberty to withdraw with&shy;out
any amercement or fine, and this freedom has been in use from the
aforesaid Conquest.—(<i>Rotuli Hundredorum</i>, temp. Edw. 1., 1818,
Vol. II., p. 823.)</p>

* Thomas de Lewknore married Lucy, heiress of Thomas de Arderne, who
inherited from the de Says. She is said (see “Testa de Nevill,”
<i>temp</i>. Hen. III. and Ed. I) to hold the whole township of “Solphorne”
in frank marriage.</p>

other counties).—Calendar of Inquis. Post Mortem, 22nd Ed. I.</p>
<p>
Thomas de Abbresbury.—“Sulthorne maner' extent.  Oxon.”—<i>Ibid</i>.  temp.
Ed. I.</p>

Ricardi.”—<i>Ibid</i>., 1Oth Ed. II.</p>

<p>
 In 1357, in a Patent Roll of the 31 Ed. III., there occurs the entry
of a writ, “about the Hamlet of Foresmore, belonging to Roger de
Cottesford, and (about) the enclosed road between Cot&shy;tesford and
Sulthorne, and a license to enclose the said hamlet.”—White Kennett,
Vol. II., p. 115 (note).</p>

temp. Rich. II.</p>
<p>
In the Inquisitions of Henry VI., William Duke of Suffolk, held, in
the County of Oxford, land in Thorp, Cudlynton, Sul&shy;thorne, etc. And in
Napier's <i>History of Swyncombe and Ewelme</i> it appears that after the
murder of the said Duke, Alice his widow was seized of the said
lands. (p. 104, note B).</p>
<p>
In 36 Hen. VI., “Joh'es Dynham, miles,” holds the manor with twelve
others in the county (Cal. Inquis. post mortem). This John Dynham
apparently became possessed of Souldern through a marriage with one of
the de la Poles.</p>
<p>
In the reign of Elizabeth a son of the aforesaid John Dynham, married,
first, Elizabeth, d. of Sir John Dormer, and secondly Penelope, d.  of
Sir Rich. Wenman. During the same reign, the manor of Souldern was
purchased by the Weedons from the Right Hon. H. Compton, Sir John
Arundel, John Dormer, and Paul Tracy, who were seized of the estate in
right of their wives.  It continued in the Weedon family until the
year 1710 when John Weedon died and left his manor and estate to
Samuel Cox and Alicia <i>née</i> Kilby, his wife; and their direct descendant
Col. Sneyd Cox, of Broxwood Court and Eaton Bishop, in the county of
Hereford, is the present lord.</p>
