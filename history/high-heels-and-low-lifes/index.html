<p>ACTRESS Minnie Driver and comedian Mel Smith were in Souldern last
 week for the filming of a new British action comedy.
 Crews spent two days last week just outside the village at a viaduct
 near to the M40 to film an explosion scene for High Heels and Low
 Lifes, directed by Mel Smith.</p>
<p>The land where filming took place belongs to Dawn and John Malins
 of Wharf Farm. Mrs Malins said: They were apparently looking for a
 location with a viaduct and the location manager saw a viaduct on the
 ordnance survey map. They needed one that was the right height in a
 grass field with cows. We were able to supply that.</p>
<p>The film crew arrived at the farm on Monday evening and filming
took place on Tuesday and Wednesday. The scene involved a car driving
into a field of cows and a box being thrown from a passing train into
the field below.</p>
<p>Film stars Minnie Driver, Oscar-nominated for her role in Good Will
Hunting, and Mary McCormack, of Deep Impact and Private Parts fame,
were on location for the shoot. Railtrack allowed the film crew to
film from the viaduct and paramedics and fire crews were on standby as
the explosion was carried out. The Malins daughter Jessica, 23,
managed to catch a glimpse of the action and Mrs Malin s sister in-law
and her three children came over from Bicester to watch the
filming. Dawn Malins, who spoke to Mel Smith and Mary McCormack, said:
I was really quite surprised as we have never been approached before
for any filming. It was a bit time-consuming but it was also quite
fun. The people on set were all very approachable and friendly.</p>
<p>About 30 of the Malins 120 cows also got their five minutes of fame
as they were needed for the scene. And the Malins son Mark, 25, and
his friend Christian Wright, 25, from Somerton, supervised the cows
for the shoot. On Wednesday morning Mark, who usually milks the cows,
had to get up early to get them milked before another day of
filming. Mrs Malins said: It was quite funny because the cows were
quite laid back and when the car came into the field they wouldn t
move out of the way.</p>
<p>The film follows the tale of two best friends, Frances (McCormack)
and Shannon, (Driver) struggling to do good with limited resources. 
Frustrated with their lives, when they accidentally overhear a heist
taking place in their neighbourhood, they devise a plan to blackmail
the gang, but events spiral out of control.</p>
<p>The film is being produced by Fragile Films. It also stars The Fast
Show's Mark Williams and is due for release next year.</p>
