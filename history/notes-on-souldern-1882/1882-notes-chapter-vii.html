<h3 id="TOC-Cox-Pedigree.-">Cox Pedigree.*</h3>
<p>The Cox family, now lords of the
Manors of Broxwood and Eaton Bishop, in the county of Hereford, and of
Souldern, Oxon, claim descent from Clement Cox, a favourite of Queen
Emma, mother of Edward the Confessor. Edward bestowed on him the
government of the western parts of the realm, and raised him to a high
position at court. His son, who was created an earl, fought with his
retainers on behali of Harold at the battle of IIastings, but
afterwards submitted to the Conqueror, and was entrusted by William
with the governorship of the country north of the Tyne.</p>

 Cox kindly furnished us with a copy of the family pedigree. Many
 interesting details have been unavoidably omitted in this short
 sketch.</p>
</div>
<p>He lost his life endenvouring to suppress
one of the Saxon insurrections. The son of this Earl Cox, Clement, is
said to have acquired large estates in Herefordshire. In the reign of
Henry VI. Sir Gabriel Cox, who married A. de Grey, was a zealous
partizan of the House of Lancaster, and was killed at the battle of
Tewkesbury. His son John was a great favourite of Henry VII. and Henry
VIII., and his grandson, John Cox, was a courtier in the reign of
Mary. At the acces­sion of Elizabeth he lost his court favour, and,
entering the Spanish service, spent nearly 30 years in the various
engagements between the Spaniards and the Dutch. He eventually lost
his life in the battle of Neimport in Flanders, under archduke Albert
of Austria. His son Richard, returning to England, was knighted by
James I., on his acces­sion, and spent the remainder of his life
peaceably on his estate. His son, also named Richard, served in the
office of High Sheriff of Herefordshire in the reign of James I. He
was offered a baronetcy by Charles I., but declined the honour. When
the civil war broke out, he, with a regiment raised from his estates,
declared for the king, and this troop of horse, led by himself and his
son, rendered good service to the royal cause. He was killed at the
battle of Naseby by a musket shot in the groin. His son erected a
monument of black marble to his memory, which recites that “he was
24th titular Earl Cox, was Colonel of a regiment of horse for his late
royal master, King Charles, of blessed memory, sparing no difficulties
or expenses for the best of causes, but persisting in spite of all
dangers in loyalty to his sovereign, as he sufficiently manifested in
the late fight of Naseby, where he fell fighting for his king and
country. Of whose soul Jesu have mercy.” His son Richard was a
sufferer also for the royal cause, the greater part of his fortune
being spent in the king's service. The rebel troops burnt down his
house and destroyed his property, and he was declared by the
Parliament guilty of high treason. His son, Sir John Cox, a naval
officer, served with distinction during the reign of Charles. He was
disgraced by the Commonwealth, but at the Restoration
received the honour of knighthood, together with the command of the
<i>Prince</i> man-of-war. At the outbreak of hostilities with the Dutch he
was ap­pointed commander of His Majesty's fleet, and during the
obstimately contended battle of Sole's Bay, while serving under the
Duke of York, he was killed by a cannon ball, 28th May, 1672, in the
63rd year of his age. By his wife, a daughter of Samuel Delahay, Esq.,
he had an only son, Gabriel Cox, of Farmingham Lodge, Kent, who, like
his ancestor, was conspicuous for his loyalty, aud at the abdication
of James II., followed his king to France and advanced large sums of
money to relieve his royal master's necessities. He was killed out
hunting with the king in the forest of St Gerinain's, near which place
he was buried, and an elegy was written to his memory by Sir Roger
Lestrange.† The said Gabriel married Eliza­beth, daughter of Richard
Snead, Esq., of Eaton Bishop, Herefordshire, by whom he had five sons
and three daughters. The eldest son, Samuel, followed the profession
of the law, and died suddenly at Farningham Lodge, in 1715. He married
Alicia, daughter of Richard Kilby, Esq., of Souldern, and left two
sons, Samuel, who suc­ceeded him in his estates, and Gabriel, who
married Mary, daughter of Richard Walker, Esq., of Brailes, by whom he
had two sons, Robert Kilby, who inherited his uncle's property, and
Samuel, of Eaton Bishop. The latter married Sarah, daughter of George
Duncombe, Esq., of Wonersh, in Surrey, and died January 21, 1840, in
the 94th year of his age. His only son, Samuel Cox, M.D., who married
Anne, daughter of Major Murdock McLean had four sons and seven
daughters. The only sur­viving son Richard Snead is the present
representative of the family, his heir presumptive being John Cox, of
the Middle Temple. The fourth daughter, Anne Helen, married John
Thomas Dolinan, Esq., M.D., of Pocklington, Yorkshire. This gentleman
was directly descended (through the female line) from Sir Miles
Stapleton, who, for eminent services was called to Parliament by writ
of summons as Baron
Stapleton, 1315. His descendants greatly dis­tinguished themselves
in the various wars of the Plantagenets until, in consequence of a
failure in the male line, the title became wested in Sir Thos. Metham,
who had married Elizabeth, heiress of Sir Nicholas Stapleton, the
ancestor of that Sir Thomas, killed at Marston Moor, sighting for his
king. He left two daughters, one of them espoused Thomas Dolman, Esq.,
of Pocklington. Dr. Dolman, some years before his death, petitioned
the Crown as heir of this marriage, for the confirmation of his right
to the Barony of Stapleton, and the matter was referred to the
Attorney-General, but no further steps were taken. Dr. Dolman left
issue, two sons and a daughter.</p>

Stapleton, brother of Miles Thomas, 8th Lord Beaumont.</p>
<h3 id="TOC-Gough.">Gough.</h3>
<p>This
family is undoubtedly of Welsh origin, and the name, originally spelt
Gôch, signifying “the red,” was at an early period corrupted into its
present form (see “Pennant's Tour” and “Roscoe's Wanderings”). At what
time the Goughs set­tled in Oxfordshire we cannot discover, but it
seems most probable that they obtained grants of land at the
Heyfords, Steeple and Westcot Barton, and Souldern, upon the
dissolution of the monas­teries in the reign of Henry VIII. In Brewer's
Oxfordshire, p. 542, it is mentioned that several of the family are
buried at Upper Heyford, and in Wing's Annals of Steeple and Westcot
Barton, it is stated that “they held considerable property in those
places as well as at the Heyfords and elsewhere in the neighbourhood,
but many of their gravestones within Steeple Barton Church were cast
aside in 1851. One, however, still exists to the memory of Lucie, wife
of Ferdinando Gough, daughter of Thomas Marten, of Rousham, gent, who
died in 1705. Her husband was also buried
here on Christmas Day, 1727.” In the late Mr. Turner's annals of
Oxford, from 1509–1583, the name frequently occurs, and in Beesley's
“History of Banbury,” p. 246, John Gough, is mentioned in some
letters patent of the Queen concerning the tithes, etc., of Grimsbury,
Nethercote, and Over­thorpe, 30th Eliz., 9th February, 1589. In the
same reign Richard Gough was a freeholder of Souldern, and in that
capacity was a petitioner to the Court of Chaucery in 1613. He died
and was buried in Souldern Church in 1638, and Ferdinando, his son, in
1664. The son of this Ferdinando Richard, married Anne Eeles<sup style="font-size:70%;background-color:#eee">1</sup>, daughter
of John Eeles, Esq., of Piddington, by Sarah, daughter of William
Drope,* Esq., of Aynho, North­ampton­shire. He bought and enlarged a
house at Souldern, formerly the property of the Cartwrights. His only
son, Drope, succeeded him and married Anne, daughter of — Caulfield,
Esq., of Witney. Their eldest son, Richard Drope, married Anne,
daughter of — Linden, Esq., of Southam, Warwickshire, and left a
numerous family; the eldest son being Richard Drope, who died in
1838. The only landed proprietor of the name in Souldern at the
present time is John Hill Gough, of the Middle Temple, son of Charles
third son of Richard Drope Gough, the elder.</p>

<p><sup style="font-size:70%;color:00f">1</sup> Editorial Note 2018, The details here appear to be incorrect and inconsistent with the church inscriptions listed earlier. Andrew Gough, using a Gough Family tree compiled by Graham Gough, informs us that Richard actually married an Elizabeth Bowers, in Dunns Tew in 1665. It was this Richard's son (born 1666), who is the one who married Sarah (not Anne) Eeles c 1683, being the daughter of John Eeles and Sarah Drope.</p>

* The Dropes descended from John Drope, of Huntingdull (see Waterlow's
History of Cornhill). This John Drope's sun Robert was alderman of
London, and Lord Mayor in 1473. In the 10th Edward IV, he enlarged
the conduit in Cornhill, and increased the cistern with an east end of
stone castellated in a comely manner. He was knighted, and obtained a
grant of arms from the king, “sable in a chief gulas, alion passant
gardant.” He was buried on the north side of the choir of
St. Michael's Church, under a fair tomb of grey marble, 1485. Jane,
his widow, matching with Ed. Grey, Wiscount Lisle, second son of Lord
Ferrers, of Groby, died in 1500, and was buried by her first husband
(see Stowe's Survey of London, p. 72, 74). One of Sir Robert Drope's
descendants, Thomas, B.D., was vicar of Banbury in the reign of
Elizabeth (see Beesley's History of Banbury pp. 248, 255, 258.) Other
members of the family resided at Neithrop, and Aynho until the death
of William Drope, whose only child married John Eeles, as mentioned
above. In the possession of the late Miss Gough was a curious old
cabinet, also some apostle's spoons, which came into the family
through Anne Eeles, and the coat of arms of Sir Robert Drope on
vellum.</p>
