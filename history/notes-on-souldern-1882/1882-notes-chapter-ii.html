<p>The derivation of the name of Souldern, or Soulderne, was for some
time a much vexed question. It appears, in all public documents, until
1469, as Sulthorn, with rare and very occasional variations of
Suldren, or Sulphorne; but it seems now, almost without doubt, that
the original form (for this we are indebted to the
Rev. J. C. Blomfield, our Rural Dean) was Selthorn (Anglo-Saxon), “the
great thorn,” as distinguishing it from Blackthorn and Highthorn,
places in the neigh­bourhood, and also on the line of the
Portway. The present village is in the Hundred of Plough­ley;
Deanery, Union, and County Court District of Bicester, in the Diocese
and County of Oxford, It is bounded on the north by Aynho
(North­ampton­shire), on the west by the Cherwell, on the east by
Fritwell, and on the south and south-west by Fritwell and
Somerton. The area is, according to the rate book 1444, from the
assessment, 1453 acres. The population (1881) is about 500. In 1879
there were 117 houses and 498 inhabitants, of these 262 were members
of the Church of England, 63 “exclusive Methodists,” 66 attended
church and chapel indiscriminately, 39 were Roman Catholics, and 62
ignored any form of religion. There is the Church, a Roman Catholic
Chapel, and a Wesleyan Meeting House in the village. The Rector, the
Rev. Dr. Stephenson, states that before the opening of the Oxford and
Birmingham Canal, which runs through the parish, the inhabitants of
Souldern only numbered 160 to 200 souls. The nearest point from whence
coals could be obtained was the adjoining county of Bucks, and it was
almost impossible for the poor to get any fuel. The canal having removed this difficulty, numerous
families of labourers settled in the village, and in a few years the
population more than doubled. The soil is fertile clay and loam near
the Cherwell, and sand and stone brash on the high ground. Souldern is
16 miles from Oxford, 3 from Deddington, 8 from Banbury and 7 from
Brackley and Bicester. The nearest station is Aynho, on the Great
Western line, within four miles distance. From the want of capital or
energy, or more probably of both, on the part of the inhabitants, no
successful attempt has been made to obtain a more direct route. The
modern town, as the natives delight to call it, is pleasantly situated
on the outskirts of Aynho Park, and slopes down so abruptly from the
turnpike house (well known to members of the Bices­ter hunt as
Souldern Gate) that nothing of it, save a few columns of curling
smoke, can be seen from the high road, and it was the boast and
consolation of the inhabitants in the days of the dreaded invasion of
Napoleon that their village was too hidden to attract his notice. A
relative of the compilers much given to practical joking, as was the
fashion of his time, dressed himself up one day, and, riding furiously
into the place, shouted “Napoleon!” The terrified
villagers snatched up their children and fled from their cottages,
thinking that “old Bony had come at last.” After the short and abrupt
descent to the Town Well, whence a road branches off to the Church and
Rectory, the village extends up­wards and onwards in a westerly
direction until it ends in the present Manor House, which stands on
the brow of the hill over-looking the valley of the Cherwell. The main
street, nestling as it does throughout its course under a broad belt
of trees with its substantial-looking houses built of the white stone
of the neighbourhood, and fore-courts tastefully planted with
variegated trees and shrubs, its thatched cottages covered with
apricot trees, two old Elizabethan buildings, occupied respectively by
Mr. Thomas Merry and Mr. John Bodding­ton, and its almost handsome
school, has such an air of comfort and repose that strangers and
visitors soon acquire a liking for the little out-of-the-way
village. The National School was originally
founded by William and James Minn in 1816. About 1851 Mr. James Minn
gave a piece of land and two cottages adjoining, for the accommodation
of teachers. Since the recent Education Act, the school has been much
altered and enlarged, a good house has been erected in place of the
cottages, and a clock has recently been put up. Mr. and Mrs. Tingey
(1882) are the present worthy Master and Mistress. The supply of water
in Souldern is abundant. A never-failing tream rises in a field called
“Bove-well,” which, after supplying the Town-pond, passes the Rectory,
and finally finds its way into the County Brook, which divides
Oxfordshire from North­ampton­shire. Prior to the enclosure of 1856-7,
there was another spring in that part of the common land called
Chadwell, where the water was collected in a stone tank dedicated to
St. Chad. Unfortunately the well is now stopped up. There is
undoubtedly ironstone in parts of the parish, but whether its quantity
or quality would make it worth the working remains to be seen. There
are also quarries of plank-stone. The population is chiefly
agricultural. Until recently nearly every cottager had her
lace-pillow, but modern education has closed the doors of the three
schools formerly devoted to the teach­ing of this industry in the
parish. Souldern could at one time boast of its three crosses, but
during the period of miserable vandalism which succeeded the
Reformation and reached its height at the great rebellion, these were
almost entirely destroyed. The steps and base of one, however, may
still be seen in the churchyard; the base only of another (called
Coles Cross), in Col. Cox's field (see charities); and of the third
not a vestige is left. There are no remains of butts in the parish,
though probably these at one time existed, as, by an ordinance of the
fifth year of Edward IV., it was required that “Butts should be made
in every township, at which the inhabitants were to shoot up and down
upon all feast-days under a penalty of a halfpenny for every time any
one of them neglected to perform this exercise.” We are inclined to
think that the butts at Souldern were placed where the bowling green was afterwards
established. Remains of the latter are to be traced on the right hand
side of the road leading from the village to old Soudern gate, and the
remains of the stocks were, not many years ago, also to be seen at the
corner, near the Fox Inn. The only days now kept in the village are the
14th Feb­ruary, the 29th May, Feast Day, and Christ­mas. On Valentine's
Day the children come round shouting, with outstretched hands, and
laying great accent on the last line of the distich—</p>
<blockquote style="text-indent:0em;font-style:normal">
 Good morrow, Valentine!<br />
 I be yours and you be mine,<br />
 Plaze give us a Valentine.
</blockquote>
<p>—May Day, although shorn of some of its glories. by the
intolerance of the Puritans, is still May Day, for innumerable groups
of children, dressed in their Sunday best, go from door to door with
their pretty, and often most tastefully arranged garlands and posies, bright
with king-cups and daisies, and all the bravery of spring flowers,
chanting the following quaint old ditty—</p>
<blockquote style="text-indent:0em;font-style:normal">
<p>
 Gentlemen and Ladies,<br />
   We wish you happy May,<br />
 We come to show our May Garland<br />
   Because it is May Day.<br />
     <i>Chorus</i>―Because it is May Day, &amp;c.</p>
<p>
 A branch of May we bring to you<br />
   And at your door it stands,<br />
 It is but a sprig, but it prospers a bough,<br />
  The work of our LORD'S hands.<br />
    <i>Chorus</i>―Gentlemen and Ladies  (repeat 1st Verse).
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>—0n the 29th of May, the anniversary of the
res­toration of King Charles II., a large branch of oak is displayed in
the principal street, and oak apples are extensively worn. On this day
also the annual meeting of the Souldern Club, or Friendly Society is
held. This Club was originally established in 1816, but has been
worked under a new system with great success for the last few
years. There are at present (1881) 83 actual members, who pay an
admission fee of 5s, and 4s. per quarter; and 12 honorary members, who
subscribe 10s, to £1 1s. per annum. John Bird
and Thomas Lake are the stewards, John Hill, Esq., and Amos
Welford, trustees, and James Tingey, treasurer and secretary. The
allowance during illness is 9s. per week for one year, and half-pay
for any time of sickness afterwards. At the end of every five years,
the surplus fund, with the exception of £1 per head, is divided in
proportion among the members, Those who have received more than the
amount in sick pay forfeit all claim in the division.</p>
<h3 style="text-indent:0em;text-align:center"><a name="TOC-Feast-Days-c."></a>Feast Days, &amp;c.</h3>
<p>The Village Feast, or Wake, is kept on the 1st Sunday after
the 18th of September. In all probability it was originally held on
the first Sunday after the 8th, that day being the anniversary of the
nativity of the blessed Virgin, to whom the church is dedicated. We
are told that as late as the middle of the present century Souldern
feast was looked forward to from September to September. Open house
was kept from Sunday until Saturday. Rich plum puldings were made and
joints of beef cooked by all who could afford them, and the poorest
cottage had its cake and bottle of home­made wine, Relations and
friends from all parts flocked in; old friendships were renewed, and
old differences made up. In the main street a fine row of stalls was
erected, on which both usetul and fancy articles were displayed,
china, boots and shoes, hosiery and clothing, besides the delights of
the children, such as gilt gingerbread, sugar pigs, etc. Many were the
sports also at that time: prize-fighting, jumping in in sacks, ducking for apples in tubs
of water, the hands tied behind the back, searching for sixpences in
bowls of treacle, donkey racing, climbing the greasy pole, and
skittles; and of evenings, we are sorry to add, much drinking with
the dancing, at the public-houses. Under the refining influence of
modern times most of these vanities have passed away, only two or
three apologies for stalls come to the wonted corner by the “Bull,”
with a “merry-go-round” for the children, and cocoa-nut throwing for
the young men. The observance of the 5th of November has almost
become a thing of the past, a coutemptible bonfire just serves the
purpose of collecting a few roughs, Christmas is still kept up in
somewhat of the olden style; hospitality is the order of the day, and
charities are universally dispensed; carol singers, ringers, and
mummers parade the village for more than a week. These mummers are
said to be the repre­sentatives of the secular players of whom John of
Salisbury wrote, that “their plays had little to do with
morality. They consisted of comic tales, dialogues, and stories, to
which were added coarse and indecent jests.” Whether this description
were true or not it is an undoubted fact that mummers were welcome
Christmas visitors in the halls and castles of England, and that the
pieces performed by them were of a secular character, as distinguished
from the miracle and mystery plays of the monks. What the plot of the
modern performances may be we are at a loss to say, but as far as we
can gather, old John of Salisbury's description still holds
good. There is a female, called “Molly” (always represented by the
biggest young man who can be found); a fight in which someone is
killed, and the doctor comes in on his hobby-horse to bring the
deceased to life. Then “Molly” has the tooth-ache, and the “Doctor”
operates on her, and extracts a tooth the size of a
decanter-stopper. His man “Jack” is in active attendance, and the
clown, or Jack-pudding, introduces himself in the following terms:—</p>
<blockquote style="text-indent:0em;font-style:normal">
'Ear comes as never come yet,<br />
With my gret yead, and my little wit;<br />
My yead is gret, my wit is small,<br />
I'll do my, duty to plaze you all.
</blockquote>
<p>—As
to costumes, the actors appear to have robbed every scarecrow in the
parish, and as to the play it is difficult to say which is most to be
wondered at, its intense stupidity or extreme vulgarity.—Of Souldern
worthies there are no records extant, the only individual of whom any
notice remains is one ‘Daniel Brown,’* nicknamed ‘Belcher,’ a poor
half-silly creature, the butt of the village, who is said to have
performed many eccentric feats, among others
 that of riding on the back of a bull into the town
 pond. Being strictly honest he was often employed as a messenger, and
 at other times amused himself by wandering about the country. On one
 occasion he found his way as far as London, and somewhat hungry after
 the long journey invested his all in the purchase of a lemon. This
 having failed to satisfy the cravings of hunger, and being too proud
 to beg, he found himself in Cheapside in a state of complete
 destitution. Fortunately, Mr. Cartwright's carriage was passing at
 the time. Belcher hailed the coachman with delight, and although our
 hero looked anything but a creditable acquaintance, the man acted the
 part of a good Samaritan, took him to his own lodgings, gave him a
 meal, and sent him back to his native village by the next waggon,
 with this ticket on his back, ‘Belcher Brown, Souldern Town, pass
 him on.’ Whether he again visited the metropolis is not known. We
 hear nothing more of him but his will, which runs as follows:—</p>
<blockquote style="text-indent:0em;font-style:normal">
My soul I leave unto the Lord<br />
  My body to the ground;<br />
My 'bacca box to Master Ned,<br />
  My clothes back to the Town.<br />
Unto my old friend Shepherdless (<i>sic</i>)<br />
  To him I leave my knige;<br />
I think it best to make my will<br />
  Whilst I have strength and life;<br />
But if the Shepherd should be dead,<br />
 
  My knife goes back to Master Ned.
 </blockquote>
<p>—The ‘Master Ned’ here referred to was
 one of the Clifford family, who had evidently shown Belcher some
 kindness. This document (the will) and the 'bacca box are in the
 possession of the present Mr. Clifford.” The following anecdote has been
 related to us of another Souldern man, an old and respected
 neighbour. In 1851 he went up to London to see the Great
 Exhibition. When inside the Palace he was, naturally enough, staring
 and gazing about him, when suddenly a fair specimen of the Yankee
 hailed him with, “Wal, stranger, what are you looking for?” The
 Souldern man was equal to the occasion, for he answered without
 hesitation, “Well, I was looking for a bigger fool than myself, and I
 think I have found him.”</p>
