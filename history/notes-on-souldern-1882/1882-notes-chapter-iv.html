<p>About 1066 (William the Conqueror) ― de Sai, whose name appears on
the roll of Battle Abbey, seems to have obtained a grant of the Manor
of Sulethorm. In 1261 (Henry III., 1216―1272) or much earlier Philip
Bassett† sold the said Manor to Ralph de Bray, for 40 marks of silver
(See Skelton's Antiquities of Oxfordshire, Ploughley Hundred,
p. 7). In the reign of Edward I. (1272 –1306). “Thomas de Lewknore‡
holds the Manor of Sulthorne, of Thomas de Arderne, by the service of
£1 yearly, and the said Thomas holds, from the heirs of de Say, and it
is a Manor free in itself, and has a view of frank pledges; from the
first conquest of England, and the bailiffs of our lord the king have
no entrance unless by briefs of our lord the king. And it is an
ancient warren from the first conquest of England. And the vicar of
Oxford has 4s. yearly from the time of John de Tywe, formerly vicar of
Oxford, who levied these 4s. unjustly. And it has a highway from the
conquest aforesaid. And he holds in his lordship three currucates‖ of
land, and the meadow and pasture adjoining. And he has there a free
fishery from the head of his meadow of Goldenham as far as the meadow
of Fretewelle. And the said lord of Sulthorne, if he wished, or his
attorney, shall come to the two great Hundred Courts (?) yearly from
Sulthorne. And by this they shall be free and at liberty to withdraw
without amercement or fine. And this freedom has been in use from the
aforesaid conquest.” (See
 Cal. Rolls of Ed. II.) It appears from the “Inuisitiones” of
 Ed. I., II., and III., that Thomas e Abbresbury, William de Tyngewyk,
 John de Abberbury, and Richard de Abberbury, were freeholders in this
 parish. They probably held by knights service for the Prior of
 Donyngton. In 1357, in a patent of the 31st Ed. III, there occurs the
 following notice – “About the Hamlet of Foresmere, belonging to Roger
 de Cottesford, and about the enclosed road between Cottesford and
 Sulthorn, and about a licence to enclose the said hamlet.” In the
 reign of Richard II. (1377–1399) Richard de Abberbury held lands in
 Sulthorn. In the “Inquisitiones” of Henry VI. (1422–61) “William,
 Duke of Suffolk, held in the county of Oxford, land in Thorp,
 Cudlynton, Sulthorne, and Hannewell, in the Honour of Wallingford.”
 From Napier's “History of Swincombe and Ewelme’ (1858) we find that
 after the murder of the said Duke, Alice, his widow (grand­daughter of
 Geoffrey Chaucer) was seized of the said lands. After this date we
 can discover nothing more about the manor until the reign of Elizabeth
 (1558–1603). and there is the following notice in White Kennett—“Sir
 Hugh Throckmorton instituted Lawrance Giles to the living of
 Sulthorne,” and elsewhere—“The Right Honble. H. Compton, Sir John
 Arundel, John Dormer, and Paul Tracy were seized of the Manor of
 Souldren, anciently Sulthorne, in the right of their wives.” About
 the beginning of the reign of James I, (1603–26) the above-mentioned
 persons parted with the manor to the Weedon family (see copy deed in the
 possession of Mr. Crook). Souldern appears to have escaped injury
 during the great civil war and we can only find the place mentioned
 twice in any local history of that period. First there is “an order for
 carts to Oxord for the king, from Fritwell and Soulderne”
 (counter­manded), and secondly the minister of Soulderne joined with
 others in the neighbour­hood in petitioning Parliament to spare
 Charles I. (see Beesley’s “History of Banbury”). During the
 Commonwealth (1649-60) “At the court leet held at Soulderne (1652)
 at the Manor House of John Weedon, John Dodwell is chosen constable
 in the
 place of Robert Bigmell.” Among the jurors for the keepers of the
 liberties of England, by authority of Parliament and also for the
 above-named lord of the said manor are named John Dodwell (the
 younger), Thomas Dodwell, John Dodwell, William Dodwell, and
 Ferdinando Gough. In another documeut, (of the reign of William
 III., 1689-1702) it appears that Thomas Dodwell sold a messuage house
 somewhere about the year 1693. John Weedom died in 1710, and left his
 manor and estate to Samuel Cox (then a child), the eldest son of
 Samuel Cox and Alicia Kilby, his wife, subject to the payment of
 annuities to his brothers William and Thoulas, his uncle Bernard, his
 sister Mary, and his brother-in-law Charles Howes. The house and
 furniture he left to his widow. The will was proved 9th July,
 1712. Samuel Cox, executor. There is, or ought to be, a sketch of the
 old Manor House of the Weedons, in a deed in the church chest. It
 stood in a field (close to the church) now the property of
 Mr. J. R. Crook. For the following description of Souldern House, and
 the Roman Catholic chapel appertaining thereto, we are indebted to
 George Dolinan, Esq: “The present Manor House, the property of
 Col. Cox, stands at the western extremity of the village, on the brow
 of the hill commanding an extensive view of the Cherwell walley,
 which stretches for many miles north and south, with the massive
 tower of Deddington Church rising boldly in the central landscape. A
 group of lofty elms forum a conspicuous landmark, and some forty or
 fifty years ago these were part of a stately avenue up to the
 house. The precise age of the house itself appears to be unknown, but
 some clue is afforded by the figure 1665, cut into the stonework of
 the window of a room known as the “old vestry.” It is, however,
 certain that before the close of the 17th century it was in the
 possession of Richard Kilby, Esq., who had married as his second wife
 Alice Reynolds, a lady of an old Catholic family, seated at
 Cassington. Besides a son Robert, he had by this wife three
 daughters, Alice, Mary, and Jane, of whom the first-men­tioned
 became the wife of Samuel Cox, Esq., of
Farmingham Lodge, Kent. Richard Kilby died 11th September, 1693, in
the 84th year of his age, and was buried in the church of Souldern. In
his will, after disposing of his other property and effects, he
bequeaths as heirlooms to his son, his two pots or vases, which now
stand on the lawn in front of the house, and the stone table, of which
there is no trace. (Since writing the above this stone table has
(1881) been discovered and reclaimed by Mr. Stanton, and stands near
the companion pots and vases.) The said Richard Kilby was succeeded by
his only son Robert, who married his cousin, Alicia Kilby, but had no
issue. He died 12th March, 1757, and was also interred in the Parish
Church. By his will his estates were left to his nephew Samuel, eldest
son of Samuel Cox, of Farningham. This Samuel Cox, who never married,
made Souldern House his residence from this time up to his death in
1781. He died at a good old age and was buried in the church. His
nephew, Robert Kilby Cox, oldest son of Gabriel Cox, Esq., of
Highgate, succeeded him in the manor, and during his life many
changes were made in the house. The old mullioned windows were
replaced by sash windows of the modern fashion, and a cupola which
formerly stood above the western entrance was renoved. As neither he
nor his son lived permanently at Souldern, the house was let to
various tenants, who succeeded each other, as far as we can ascertain,
in the following order:—</p>
<p>I.—Mr. Porter, agent of the Cox and Fermor
families.</p>
<p>II.—William Willan, Esq., whose wife dying here in 1805, he
shortly left the neighbourhood.</p>
<p>III.—The Comte de Marolles, a French
gentleman, who is said to have been related to Bonaparte. He returned
to his native country after the peace of 1814.</p>
<p>IV.—Capt. Richard
Fermor, a younger brother of William Fermor, Esq., of Tusmore. He died
at Souldern House in 1817.</p>
<p>V.—James Rousby, Esq., whose son, Edwards
Rousby, was born here, 1819.</p>
<p>VI.—John Hill, Esq., father of the
present Mr.
Hill, of Souldern. He lived at the Manor House from 1830 till his
death, in May, 1835.</p>
<p>VII.—Mr. John Scott, brother-in-law of the late
Mr. Hurlstone, occupied the house until 1846.</p>
<p>In Aug., 1851, the
present owner, Col. Cox, succeeded to the estate, on the death of his
cousin, Samuel Cox, Esq., of Broxwood, and, in June of the follow­ing
year, his brother in-law, the late John Thomas Dolman, Esq., M.D., of
Pocklington, Yorkshire, came to reside at Souldern. He had married,
1835, Anne Helen, fourth daughter of the late Samuel Cox, Esq., M.D.,
of Eaton Bishop, Hertfordshire. Dr. Dolman died in 1867, and his
son-in-law, the Honble. Bryan Stapleton, lived here from 1868 until
1877, when he left and was succeeded by Frederick Stanton, Esq.</p>

<p>It is an interesting matter for speculation whether the practice of
the ancient Catholic faith has ever quite died out in Souldern. The
materials for such an enquiry are, however, very incomplete, as the
earliest information is obtained from the parish register, which
commences 1567. A clue to the number of Roman Catholics in the village
in those days is assorded by the frequent occurrence of the formula,
“Secundum rituo Ecclesiæ Anglicanæ” in the list of burials. These
worls clearly imply that the persons whose names are thus
distinguished were, owing to the peculiar circumstances of the time,
buried according to the rites of the Church of England, although in
life they had not been mem­bers of that church. And if it were still
doubtful to which religious communion they belonged, the occasional
addition of the word <i>papista</i> effectually removes any hesitation. Among
the names of Souldern Roman Catholics at that period those of Weedon
and Kilby occupy a prominent place, and presumably of a humbler class
appear the Ansteys, Horns, and Lessingtons, names which have now
disappeared entirely from the roll of Souldern parishioners. From
these facts it is clear that about the middle of the 17th century, a
certain number of Catholic families were living in the village, and
not­with&amp;sh;stand­ing the penal laws to the contrary, heard mass celebrated
in one or more
private houses. Whether a domestic chapel existed in the Manor House
of the Weedons before referred to, is not known, but there is no doubt
that in the present house a chapel was in constant use from an early
period, and this interesting relic of an ancient time, remained in its
primitive con­dition until a very recent date. The old chapel at
Souldern was merely a room in the upper part of the house, measuring
about 30ft. in length. A portion of this room (about a third of the
whole) was divided from the rest of the apartment by a wooden screen,
and the part thus separated formed the sanctuary. An altar and
communion railings, also of wood completed the furniture, and a door
on the N.W. corner led into an adjoin­ing room, which served as a
vestry. This apartment con­tinued to be used until 1781, when, on the
death of Mr. Samuel Cox, it was permanently closed, and the vessels
and vestments removed to a place of safety. Before quitting this
portion of the subject, it should be mentioned that in 1877 a
secret chamber, probably a priest's hiding hole, was dis­covered, which
formed a com­munica­tion between the chapel and the room below. It was
fastened on the inside by means of a sliding bolt. It does not appear
that any regular chaplain lived at Souldern from the Reform­ation till
the last-mentioned date. Probably the mission was served by the priest
who resided at Tusmore, where, in the house of the Fermors, there was also a
domestic chapel, which existed up to 1810. When that was closed
another was opened at the old Manor House at Hardwick, and the
Rev. Alfred Maguire collected funds with which he built the present
church of the Holy Trinity, Hethe. When Dr. Dolinan came to Souldern
in 1852, it was de­cided that a chapel should be opened in the village,
the old room having fallen into a state of complete decay. An
apartment situated in the south wing of the house was therefore set
apart for the purpose. The old vestments being much worn, and besides
of an obsolete pattern, a new set was obtained in close accordance
with medieval design, and the furniture for the altar was also
provided. In the summer of 1869 Mrs. Dulman conceived the design of
building
a small chapel to the memory of her husband. The foundations were
laid in the grounds and the work was completed in 1870. On the 2nd
February this building was opened by the Very Rev. Canon O'Sullivan,
Vicar General of the Diocese, and placed under the patronage of
St. Joseph. The new chapel, though unpretending, is quite
ecclesiastical in its main features, and the open timber roof and
plain lancet windows have a pleasing effect. There is a representation
in stained glass above the altar, of our LORD'S resurrection. The
altar rails are those belonging to the original chapel. The priests
connected with Souldern House are as follows:—</p>
<p>The Rev. Samuel Corbishley</p>
<p>Rev Alfred Maguire</p>
<p>Rev. Joseph Robson</p>
<p>Rev. Hugh McCarten</p>
<p>Rev. Fred. Morris</p>
<p>Rev. Samuel Glossop</p>
<p>A well built school has been
erected close to the chapel, upon a site given by Col. Cox, and there
is a resident school mistress.</p>
