The first notice we can find of our part of the county, viz., North
Oxfordshire, is about A.D. 43, when the tribe of the Dobuni came under
the sway and protection of Aulus Plautius, who had defeated first
Cataractacus and then Togodumnus (?), both sons of the deceased chief,
Cunobelin. In 778. Offa, King of the Mercians, in his desire to extend
the boundaries of his kingdom to its ancient limits, i.e., beyond the
banks of the Thames and Cherwell, led an army across the boundaries of
the parish of Souldern immediately before he de­feated Kenwulph, King
of Wessex, at Benson, or Bensington, on the south side of the county.*
To this period may be assigned the erection of the earthwork known as
Avesditch (corruption of Offa's ditch), Wattlebank or Ashbank, which
is half-a-mile southward from the Portway. This Port­way—one of the nine
so-called Roman roads in England—crossed Northamptonshire and
Oxfordshire, and can still be distinctly traced from Walton Grounds
through Aynho Park to the turnpike gate, east of Souldern, whence it
runs along the present road towards Fritwell, passing on its way
thither the ancient Saxon barrow called Ploughley Hill† (within the
last 60 years partially levelled) the site of extensive ancient
remains. The portions of the vallum which still exist are yet in
places five feet in height, and from five to ten yards in
breadth.*</p>

<h3 id="TOC-Ancient-Remains">Ancient Remains</h3>
<p>In levelling the ground on the line of
  the Portway, in Aynho Park, above mentioned, the workmen disinterred
  a skeleton (supposed to be British from its position, i.e., the
  knees being gathered up towards the breast). It was enclosed in a
  cistvaen composed of four stone slabs, placed at right angles. A
  little further southward another skeleton lying at full length was
  discovered at the declivity of the hill between Aynho and
  Souldern. About 70 years ago in the carpenters' yard at the western
  extremity of the village were found some Roman coins and a bead
  necklace, which were bought by the late P. Pigott Couant, Esq.; and
  still more recently, upon a farm the property of Mr. John Rowland
  Crook, were discovered the following coins: “Carausius,”
  A.D. 289-293 (one of the thirty tyrants of Great Britain); (Flavius)
  “Valens,” A.D. 364-378 (son of Gratian); “Claulius
  Gothicus,” A.D., 268-270 (probably Emperor after Gallienus,
  was another of the thirty tyrants who reigned in Britain and Gaul);
  “Tetricus,” 267-272 (a Roman senator, saluted Emperor in
  the reign of Aurelius); as well as some tesserie, and a small bronze
  figure, evidently a household god. It is probable that if further
  ex­cavations were made on this spot interesting antiquities
  would be discovered. The following account of remains found in 1844
  is by Sir Henry Dryden:–</p>
<p>“Sepulchral remains
  found at Somldern. In January, 1844, having heard that remains had
  recently been discovered at Souldern, I visited the spot, which is
  on the west side of the narrow road leading out of the main street
  of Souldern down hill southwards. The ground falls from the garden
  on all sides but the west. A skeleton and urn were discovered by
  workmen who were digging stone, from whose information and a compass
  I made out their relative positions. The soil was about two feet
  thick on a deep rock of limestone. The skeleton, of man's stature,
  judging by the teeth about thirty or thirty-four years of age,
  stretched out at full length on its back W. by S. and E. by N., head
  to the former, rock hollowed out to receive it, the bones being
  three feet under the surface. On the right
  hand side of its head lay a pair of bone ornaments two inches long,
  in shape four-sided cones, having on each side nine small engraved
  circles. At the small end of each is inserted an iron rivet, which
  is probably the remains of a hook, for suspension perhaps, from the
  ear by another brass ring. About the head were many fragments of
  thin brass, which, when collected and put together, form parts of
  two bands, the first of which is seven inches long and three-fourths
  wide, and has encircled the lower part of a leathern skull cap. The
  cope of the leather and this brass band were held together by a thin
  concave brass binding, in the hollow of which fragments of leather
  are still to be seen. On each side of the helmet attached to the
  brass band was an ornamental hinge for a chinstrap. Of the other
  band about one foot five inches are existing, the whole of which is
  of equal width, and one-eighth narrower than the first. It was
  probably the binding of the edge of the helmet where there would be
  a seam, or intended to encircle the helmet close above the other
  binding. On both these bands are rivets which shew that the leather
  rivetted was three-sixteenths thick. Nothing else, according to my
  informant, was found with the skeleton. About seven feet north of
  its head was found an urn containing bones, about the same depth
  under the surface as the skeleton. The urn was in fragments when
  discovered, but has since been restored. It is of rather coarse
  black pottery, averaging about three-sixteenths of an inch in
  thickness, and imperfect in the lip. What remains is
  seven-and-three-quarters inches high, and eight-and-three-quarters
  inches in diameter. It is ornamented on the upperpart by two
  horizontal bands of dancetted pattern. At about two-thirds up the
  sides are four roundish projections at equal distances from each
  other, and between them semi-circular bands of ornament. About five
  feet E. by S. from the urn, and eleven feet from the head of the
  skeleton, they found a number of bones in a heap, which they thought
  had been moved before. These were probably the remainder of a body
  or bodies, of which parts were enclosed in one or all the three
  urns. The workmen soon stopped digg­ing but
  some months afterwards began again to get stone in the same garden,
  and found, about two-and-a-half feet below the surface, two more
  urns. The first contained fragments of bones. It is five-and-a-half
  inches high, and eight-and-a-half inches in the widest diameter;
  composed of light grey pottery, and very thin, and great part being
  only one eighth of an inch thick. The ornamental work on it is very
  slight, of which the chief part is dancetted pattern, each triangle
  being filled with from nine to thirteen small circular
  indentations. The other urn was im­perfect in the upper part,
  and probably was frac­tured when interred, for it contained the
  skull of an infant a few days old, which was too large to have been
  admitted through the mouth of the urn. Many sepulchral urns have
  been discovered, evi­dently fractured before interment,
  containing bones too large to have passed through the mouth, and
  occasionally the vessels have been joined together again, after the
  insertion of the hones. This urn is five-and-a-half inches high (the
  lip being lost) and six-and-a-half inches in its widest diameter. It
  is of black pottery, and about a quarter of an inch thick, and
  destitute of ornament. None of the urns were protected by stones or
  tiles from the pressure of thể carth. About twenty-five feet W. by
  N. of these was found another skeleton several years ago; and about
  1840 ‘some things’ were found about thirty or forty feet
  N.E. of the skele­ton. I was unable to learn any further
  particulars of those discoveries. The skeletons discovered north of
  Aynho village lay N. and S. but we are not informed to which point
  the heads were laid.§ Most of the skeletons found in these
  parts, accom­with pottery of this class, have had the heads
  between S. and W. From the pottery found at Souldern I am inclined
  to attribute these remains to the Romanized Britons of the fifth or
  sixth century, but in the opinion of some anti­quaries they
  belong to the Saxons of the eighth century. The three urns, brass
  straps and one of the two bone ornaments, are now in my possession,
  having been given to me by the
  Rev. Dr. Stephenson and others.”—(H. Dryden, 1845.)</p>
