<p>Some time after the conquest Jordan de Sal gave the church of
Sulethorne to the Abbey of Egnesham or Ensham, in the following terms:
“I, Jordan de Sai (or Say), for the soul of my son William, on the day
on which I have committed him to the tomb at Egnesham, have given up
to the said monastery the Churen of Sulethorn. The witnesses are
‘Ranulph my son’, and others.” (From a char­tulary of Ensham, numbered
Claudius, A, 8, fol. 135, in the Cotton Library, now in the British
Museum.) This gift was confirmed by Hugh, Bishop of Lincoln, who also
confirms a pension of two marks of silver† yearly from the church of
Sulethorn. In 1218, Willian de Warres, nephew of Robert, Abbot of
Egnsham, was admitted to the Vicarage, when the monks had get their
pension up to 100 shillings. A little later Robert de Haye, the rector
(<i>sic</i>) and the Abbot of Oseney had a con­tention as to land at Mixbury,
which was adjusted by a compromise. In 1233 there is the following
notice—“To all sons of our Holy Mother the Church, to whom the present
writ shall come, the Priors of St. John and St. James send greeting, and
recite a mandate from Pope Gregory, wherein it is stated that the Prior
and Convent of St. Frideswide, of Oxford, have, by a plaint, shown
that Robert of Sulthorn and Nicholas of Beckele, a trusty knight, and
divers others, do, in the matter of tithes and holdings, wrong the
said Prior and Convent, and further, that His Holiness has ordered the
Dean of Northampton and the Priors of St. John and St. James, or any
two of them, to summon the parties before them, and decide the
question at issue with­out appeal, and further reciting that upon
parties being so summoned, Robert, Rector of Sulthorn, confessed in
court that the tithes of one hide of land, which is called the ‘Hide
of Sulthorn’ is within the bounds of the parish of Frettewelle, and so
by common right belonging to the church thereof, and by the same
right to the Canons of St. Frideswide. Whereupon it was adjudicated
that the said tithes should belong to the said Prior of
Frideswide, and he <i>alienated</i> from the said Robert and his
church of Sulthorn for ever. The priest of Sulthorn renewed this suit
the following year; the Pope appointed three more commissions, other
than those before mentioned. These confirmed the former sentence, but
the priest appealed to Rome again, and ultimately won his cause,
subject to a yearly payment of 10s. to the Priory.“ (A great
portion of the glebe, now called “Inlands” farm, is in the
parish of Fritwell.) “The Rector of the church of Sulthorne
holds (by the same fee) one hide of land which was formerly given to
the church of Sulthorne in perpetual alms” (Testa de Nevill). In
1296, John de Bernewelle, parson of the church of Sulthorn, had
recovered his seizin against Thomas de Lewknore and Lucie his wife, of
the possession of his pasture in Sulthorn, which belongs to his
freeholder in the same parish (Abbreviatio Rotulorum originalium,
Ed. I.) And in 1297, the satile John de Bernwelle has a letter of
protection by patent dated 2nd March of that year. [John de Bernewelle
no doubt in consideration of a contribution to the Royal Exchequer
obtains a rotection from further taxation.) In the 33rd of Edward
I. (1305) there are “pleadings before Ralph de Hengham and his fellow
justices of the bench of our Lord the King, in Trinity term, Thomas,
Abbot of Egneshain, by his attorney, appeared against Lucie, wife of
Thomas de Lewk­more and against Peter of Sche­oyn­don, to hear an assize
of darrien presentment, which the said Thomas did here in the court
arraign the assize (that is, bring the cause into court) against them,
about the advowson of the church of Soulthorn, which is vacant.” The
report goes on to state that. the said Lucie and Peter defended the suit
against the said abbot, but not appearing, judgment was claimed by
him upon their default. The jury found that the vacancy occurred upon
the death of one John de Bernewelle, and those who have been consulted
upon the rights of the Abbot, affirm that in the 20th Henry
III. (1236) an agreement was, made between Nicholas, then Abbot of
Egnesham, and one Lucie de Arderne (grandmother of Lucie. de Lewknore)
by which she ack­now­ledged that the advowson
belonged to the aforesaid Abbey of Egnesham, and that when a vacancy
in the office of Abbot happened, the Bishop of Lincoln as patron of the
said office did confer the church on Geoffrey de Stokes, one of his
clergy. And those who have been consulted about collusion between the
parties as to the value of the church, find there was no collusion,
that the church is of the value of 20 marks yearly, and that the
period of six months for present­ment has not elapsed. Therefore, it
was allowed that the aforesaid abbot Thomas should have a writ to the
Bishop of Lincoln, and that upon its presentation he (the Bishop)
should admit a fit person to the aforesaid church, and the abbot was
allowed ten marks from the defendant in compensation for his
losses. (See White Kennett, vol. i., p. 500.) In the “Testa de
Nevill,” temp Henry III., and Ed. I, it is stated—“The Deanery of
Burncestre (Bicester), church of Sulthorne, pension deducted 10s.” And
in Roll 28, “In the same manner the rector, Adam de Keresaye, gives
information that he in the rectorial court at Oxford has recovered his
seizin against Lucie, wife of Thomas de Lewknore and others, of 40s,
rent, with (property?) in Sulthorne.” In Roll 15 the same occurs
again, the only difference being the “e” at the end of
Sulthorn. (Taxatio Ecclesiastica of Pope Nicholas IV., Diocese of
Lincoln.) We hear of no further law-suits after this, only of the
constant change of the clergy in the earlier centuries (as will be
seen from the following list) and which may probably be accounted for
by the tithes belonging to Eynsham Abbey.</p>

Sir Hugh Throckmorton, of Souldern, knight</p>
<p>Except where otherwise
mentioned, the above were all presented by the Abbey of Fgnsham. The
living afterwards became Crown Property. From 1571 to 1647 we fail to
find definite information of the names of rectors. The
Rev. J. W. Pieters, sometime bursar of St. John's, Cambridge, kindly
sent us the following extracts from the coll books : “The advowson of
Soulderne in Oxfordshire, together with three other benefices, was
iven to St. John's College, Cambridge, by Archishop Williams, under
letters patent, dated 30th December 1623. The grant was ratified by
the King, 1625. (See Hatchet's “Life of Archbisho Williams,” and
Baker's “History of St. John's College,” edited by Mayor.)</p>
<p>Thomas Hodges, D.D., admitted Fellow on Mr. Ashton's foundation,
19th June, 1644, by order of the Duke of Manchester, in place of
Thomas Thornton, who refused the covenant. The said Thomas Hodges was
presented to the living of Souldern, 18th October, 1647, but was
shortly afterwards ejected, and again presented in 1662</p>
<p>The name of
Thomas Hardinge, B.D., does not appear in Mr. Pieter's list. He was
rector of Souldern between 1647 and 1662, but how he came there we
cannot learm. It mav be well here to remark that Charles I. was
finally defeated in 1645, at Naseby, and Charles II. was restored in
1660. It is almost impossible to be accurate as to the holders of
livings between these dates, probably the residence of many clergymen
was connived at or over-looked. At all events, Mr. Hardinge seems to
have lived, and worked, and died at Souldern without the knowledge of
St. John's College. (For further particulars of Rev. T. Hardinge see
“Monuments”)</p>

<h3 id="TOC-The-Rev.-Jeffrey-Shaw.">The Rev. Jeffrey Shaw.</h3>
<p>(A) From Nicholl's “Illustrations of
 the Literary History of the 18th Century” (1822), vol. iv., 119. Part
 of a letter from Mr. Edward Walker, Fellow of St. John's College,
 Cambridge, to his friend in the country, dated Dec. 6, 1706. “I
 should scarce have mentioned anything of the matter you write about,
 on my own account, but as since you have given yourself the trouble
 of enquiry, I am, I think, in friendship obliged to relate all that I
 know about the matter, and I do so the more willingly because I can
 so soon produce my authority. Mr. Shaw, to whom the apparition
 appeared, was lector of Soldern, or Souldern, in Oxfordshire, late of
 St. John's College, Cambridge, aforesaid, on whom Mr. Grove, his old
 fellow collegiate called, in July last, in his journey to the West,
 when he staid a day or two, and promised to see him again on his
 return, which he did, and staid three days with him. In that time,
 one night after supper, Mr. Shaw told him there happened a
 pass­age which he could not conceal from
 him, being an intimate friend, and one to whom the transaction might
 have something more relative than another man. He proceeded
 therefore, and told him that about a week before that time, viz.,
 July 28, 1706, as he was singking and reading in his study, about
 eleven o'clock at night, there came to him the apparition of
 Mr. Naylor, formerly fellow of his college, and dead some years ago,
 a friend of Mr. Shaw's, in the same garb he used to be in, and with
 his hands clasped before him. Mr. Shaw, not being much surprised,
 asked him how he did, and desired him to sit down, which Mr. Naylor
 did. They both sat there a considerable time and entertained one
 another with various discourses. Mr. Shaw then asked after what
 manner they lived in a separate state. He answered, ‘Far different
 from what they do here,’ but that he was very well. Mr. Shaw enquired
 further whether there were any of their old acquaintances in that ple
 where he was. He answered, “No, not one,” and then proceeded and told
 him that one of their old friends, named Orchard, should die quickly,
 and that he himself (Mr. Shaw) should not be long after. There was
 mention of several other people's names, but who they were, or upon
 what occasion, Mr. Grove cannot, or will not, tell. Mr. Shaw then
 asked whether he would not visit him again before that time came, but
 he answered he could not; he had but three days allowed him, and
 further he could not go. Mr. Shaw then said, ‘<i>Fiat Voluntas
 Domini</i>,’ and the apparition left him. This is word for word
 as Mr. Shaw told Mr. Grove, and Mr. Grove told me.</p>
<p>“What
 surprised Mr. Grove was that as he had in his journey homewards
 occasion to ride through Clepton, or Claxton, he called upon
 Mr. Clarke, fellow of our college aforesaid, and curate there. When
 enquiring after college news Mr. Clarke told him that Arthur Orchard†
 died that week, August 6, 1706, which very much shocked Mr. Grove,
 and brought to his mind the story of Mr. Shaw afresh. About three
 weeks ago Mr. Shaw 
  died of an apoplexy (in the desk), the same distemper poor Arthur
Orchard died of. Since this strange completion of matters, Mr Grove
has told this relation, and stands to the truth of it, and that which
confirms the narrative is that he told the same to Dr Baldiston, the
present vice-Chancellor, and Master of Emanuel College, above a week
before Mr. Shaw's death, and when he came to the college he was no way
surprised as others were, What furthers my belief in its being a true
ver­sion, and not a dream, is Mr. Grove's incredibility of stories of
this nature, and considering them both as men of learning and
integrity, the one would not first have dec­lared, nor the other have
spread the same, were not the matter itself serious and
real. — Yours, etc., Edward Walker,”</p>

<p>For the possession of the scarce
tract, mentioned in Smith's catalogue, and entitled Offley (Williau),
“Sermon on the Death of the Rev. Geoffrey Shaw, Rector of Soulderne,
Oxfordshire, who died whilst he was in the church at evening prayer”
(4to, 1707), the compilers are indebted to the kindness of Mr. Madan
The Mr. Naylor spoken of in this narra. tive is mentioned in “Jordan's
History of Enstone,” p. 191. “Mr. Naylor died in 1704, and was buried
July 1st, of the same year. Affidavit was made before Mr. Bridesake,
Rector of Swarford. On a corner buttress of the church porch there is
a small diamond-shaped white marble slab to his memory, bearing an
inscription of which the following is a trans­lation―“Near this spot is
deposited John Naylor, Master of Arts, Fellow of University College,
and Vicar of this church. He died June 29th, A.D., 1704, in the 49th
year of his age. Grievously dispirited in the house of the
LORD.’”</p>
<h3 id="TOC-Description-of-the-Church.">Description of the Church.</h3>
<p>In the Ecclesiastical and Architectural
Topo­graphy of England, part iv., 0xfordshire, published by John Henry
Parker, 1850, is the following notice — “Souldern, St. Mary, chancel,
nave, with S. aisle and tower. The Chancel is modern, the aisle
windows are good, early decorated.
The nave has a clerestory, and retains some
ancient carved seats.&amp;dagger; The tower is Early
Norman having walls of great thickness.”</p>
<p>—A cornice of this church is engraved in Rickman, p. 163. In
September, 1877, the church was inspected by Arthur Hodgson, Esq., of
Bloxham (architect), who made the following report –“The Church of
St. Mary, Souldern, is a very picturesque and most interesting
structure. It is at the present time sadly in want of a thorough
restoration, and the chancel such a bad piece of modern work that it
would be quite impossible to do anything but pull it down, and build a
new one of the same size as the original, and if possible mpon the old
foundations, at the same time turning the fine old arch again to its
proper use. The mave is parted from the south aisle by three pointed
arches, resting on round columns, the capitals and bases of which are
early Norman, and appear to have been turned upside down.” The north
and south clerestory windows are very poor, merely square
openings. Some of the windows of the aisle are elaborate and curious
specimens of late decorated work. The porch is also about the swine
date, and there is a well-moulded doorway, without capitals to the
jambs (the labels terminate in heads) leading from it into the aisle.”
In an appeal to the public for funds towards the restoration of the
church, Dr. Rotton quotes the following lines from the “Miscellaneous
Sonnets” of Wordsworth, which were written during one of the poet's
visits to the rectory as the guest of his college friend, the
Rev. Robert Jones, then rector of the parish:</p>
<p>A PARSONAGE IN OXFORDSHIRE.</p>
<p>“Where holy ground begins, unhallowed ends,”**<br />
Is marked by no distinguishable line;<br />
The turf unites, the pathways intertwine,<br />
And wheresoe'er the stealing footstep tends,<br />
Garden, and that domain where kindred friends<br />
And neighbours rest together, here confound<br />
Their several features, mingled like the sound<br />
of many waters, or as evening blends<span><br />
With shady night. Soft airs from shrub and flower<br />
Waft fragrant greetings to each silent grave,<br />
And while those lofty poplars* gently wave<br />
Their tops, between them comes and goes a sky<br />
Bright as the glimpses of eternity.
To saints accorded in their mortal hour.”</span></p>
<div class="footnote">
<p>†    These seats were removed in 1855 when the Church was
re-pewed.</p>
<p>** The churchyard has lately been planted and levelled.</p>
</div>
<p>When the above lines were written the Rectory garden came up to the
north side of the Church, and was only parted from the churchyard by a
sunk fence. The Rectory itself is a well built and picturesque-looking
gabled house, said to be a good specimen of the parsonages of days
gone by, From the appearance of the ground upon the north and west
side, there must at one time have been good fish­ponds on the
premises. Since Mr. Hodgson's report in 1877 there has been a most
strenuous effort headed by the venerable Rector (Dr. Stephenson) and
his family, to carry out all the improvements it was possible to
make. For the organ, which is a very good one, the parish is also
mainly indebted to the liberality of the Rev. Dr. Stephenson, The
hideous gallery (partly erected in 1815), which blocked out the
massive Norman arch leading into the tower and two of the best windows
in the aisle, has been completely swept away. The pillars and arches
in the nave have been scraped, and the whole building has undergone a
thorough cleansing and colouring, and the following gifts and
additions, as may be seen from entries added to the Register of 1688,
by Dr. Rotton, have been made to the church.‡</p>
<p>I. A new altar of pitch
pine, with oak top (made at Oxford).</p>
<p>II. Crimson cloth for the same. III.</p>
<p>Covering of crimson cloth, silk fringed.</p>
<p>IV. Polished brass cross (given by Mr. J. Cobbin)</p>
<p>V. Four flower vases of polished brass.</p>
<p>VI. Two polished brass candlesticks, each hold­ing five
lights.</p>
<p>VII. Large eastern window curtain, serving at present as
reredos.</p>
<div class="footnote">
<p>* These poplars, which stood in a field, now occupied by
 Mr. Hurlstone, were cut down some years ago.</p>
<p>‡ A list of these was
shown to, and approved of, by the Rural Dean, on his official
visitation Oct. 1880.</p>
</div>
<p>VIII. A pair of crimson dorsal curtains, suspended from polished
brass rods.</p>
<p>IX. Polished brass service, Desk for the altar, and
Service book bound in morocco.</p>
<p>X. Two sets of altar linen, one plain,
the other  of finest double damask (figured).</p>
<p>XI. Book of Common
Prayer, half-calf Red Rubric and Lection­ary, (Dr. Rotton).</p>
<p>XII. A
Bible Morocco-bound, Whit Sunday, 1881. (J. H. &amp; A. P. G.)</p>
<p>XIII. Curtains of Crimson Felt, fixed behind the great Western arch,
as well for ornament as for use.</p>
<p>XIV. September 14, 1880, three
Vitre­maine glass lights, “The Virgin and Child,” “The Cruci­fixion,” and
“CHRIST, the King of Glory,” were placed in the Chancel window (by
Dr. Rotton), also a small single light, “St. Peter,” in the
Tower. (J. H. G.)</p>
<p>XV. An Oak Lectern, presented by Dr. Rotton. And in
the autumn of 1881 a handsome oak door was put up, at considerable
expense, by subscription, in the Porch.</p>
<p>The list of vessels for the
Holy Communion, belonging to St. Mary's, Souldern (Aug., 1880), is as
follows:―</p>
<p>I. Pure Silver Flagon, given Christmas Day, 1879, by
J. H. Gough, Frederick Stanton, and George Stratton, Esqrs.</p>
<p>II. Pure
Silver Paton (a thank-offering, August, 1880).</p>
<p>III. Silver electro water cruet (Dr. Rotton).</p>
<p>The original holy vessels, made of the white
silver of former days, are—</p>
<p>I. A pure Silver Paton of 1634.</p>
<p>II. A pure
Silver Chalice, old and roughly made but of the very best silver.</p>
<p>The
following is an inventory of church goods, etc., removed from the
church of Souldern in the 6th Edward WI. : – “Exchequer, 2 R, Church
Goods, 4 (A 5), Oxford, Parish of Souldern, file 7-155, No. 21. This
inventory, indented, made the 2nd day of May, in the sixth year of the
reign of our Soverign Lord King Edward the 6th, of all the goods, plate,
jewels, and other ornaments, pertaining to
the Parish Church of Souldern, in the county of Oxford. between Sir
William Reynolds, knight, Thomas Breedy and Thomas Cowsford, amongst
others, commissioners appointed in the said county, for the survey of
the said goods with the premises of the one part, and Thomas Bond and
Thomas Symes of Souldern aforesaid of the other part: Witnesseth that
all the goods and other premises hereafter written belonging to the

<p>We cannot conclude this
short description of the church and its belongings without expressing
a fer­vent hope that at no distant period the Master and Fellows of
St. John's, Cambridge, patrons of this valuable living since the reign
of James I., will liberally contribute towards the rebuilding of the
fine and well proportioned old chancel, destroyed at the beginning of
the century by one of their own body, who was allowed by them to erect
the present mean and paltry substitute without let or
hindrance.</p>

schoolmaster, and kindly sent to us in 1880, by George Dolman,
Esq.</p>
<p>Minn—William and James Minn, elsewhere mentioned in these notes
as benefactors to the school, are buried in the churchyard, but
there are two monuments in the church to members of their family,
which read as: follows:–</p>
<p>“Sacred to the memory of William James Minn,
son of Robert and Hannah Mimn, of Shrewsbury, who perished at sea in
the night of the 19th June, 1849, in 30, south latitude, and 10° 30",
west longitude, aged 18 years and 10 months, to the great grief of all
who knew him.” Also,</p>
<p>To the memory of James Minn, soldier, brother of
the above-named Robert Minn. He likewise died at sea on his voyage to
Canada, in the year 1831, aged 44 years. He served 14 years in the
Hussars, under the Marquis of Anglesey, and two years in the
Peninsula, in the 3rd Regiment of Lancers, and had an honourable
discharge from both Regiments. His first action was “Corunna,” his
last “Waterloo.” “The sea shall give up her
dead.”</p>
<p>Rousby—James Henry, son of James Edwards Rousby, Esq., and Caroline his wife. He
died 18th October, aged 5 years</p>
<p>Tabram— “To the memory of James
Frederick Tabram, born 21st March, 1834, died 23rd Nov., 1838 (nephew
of the Rev. Dr. Stephenson).</p>
<p>Weedon—As will be seen hereafter the
Weedons purchased the Manor of Souldern from the descendents of the
Throckmortons, and bequeathed the same to Samuel Cox, in 1710</p>
<p>The
following members of the Weedon family appear to have been buried in
the church:―</p>
<p>Bernard Weedon, 1679</p>
<p>Ignatius Weedon, 1683</p>
<p>Mary Weedon, widow, 1689</p>
<p>Frances Weedon, widow of John Weedon, Esq., 1701</p>
<p>The said John Weedon, 1702</p>
<p>Elizabeth, wife of Bernard Weedon, jun., 1708</p>
<p>John Weedon, Esq., 1710</p>
<p>Bernard Weedon, 1713</p>
<p>Mary Weedon, 1728</p>
<p>William Weedon, 1741</p>
<p>And Widow Weedon, 1744</p>
<p>Nearly all the Weedons seem to have been
Roman Catholics. Their monuments may still be seen near the north
door. One of them has the Weedon arms carved as an escutcheon empaled
with the arms of the wife</p>
<p>There is another stone on the other side of
the church, with the names of Weedon and Gough upon it</p>
<p>Westcar—The
Westcars are also mentioned further on in these notes, as being
benefactors to the parish. Of this family the following are uried in the
church :―</p>
<p>Samuel died May 11, 1793, aged 33</p>
<p>Thomas died March 1, 1809, aged 53</p>
<p>Mary died June 20, 1793, aged 35</p>
<p>Elizabeth died March 31, 1820, aged 65</p>
<p>Children of Thomas Westcar (gent) and Elizabeth his wife</p>
<p>Thomas Westcar (gent) died Sept. 27, 1788,</p>
<p>Elizabeth, his wife,
Aug. 10, 1805, aged 88</p>
<p>Mr. John Rowland Crook is the only descendant
of the Westcar family now living in the parish, though we believe Hill
House Farm is still possessed by another branch</p>
<p>Nearly all the rectors
are buried in the chancel. The first in date is on a brass recently
restored by Dr. Rotton :—</p>
<p>“Of your charitie py for the soul of Maister
Thoms Warn, late pson. of this Church, which decesed XI. die Apl,
anno, —.”*</p>
<p>There is a full length effigy of the priest in his vestments</p>
<p>Hardinge—“Here lies interred the body of the learned and Reverend
Thomas Hardinge, Batchelor of Divinity. Sometime one of the Masters of
Westminster School, commonly called the Grecian, from his excellency
in that tongue. Rector of Soulderne 26 years, and author of the great
Ecclesiastical Historie. His better monument he erected himself
where his memorie and his successors live together in the faire
parsonage house, where he was not only emiuent for his holy and pious
conversation, but by his hospitality and charitie. His epitaph is
legible in the last volume of his works. He suffered his mortal change
October 10th, 1648, in the time of the Great Revolution, and change in
Church and State, living and dying himself in the same constancy of
obedience, a true son of the church and professor of the aneient
catholique faith. Anima mea cum patribus.” Mr. Hardinge's armorial
bearings are engraved on the monument.</p>
<div class="footnote">
<p>* This date is somewhat difficult to make out, but seems to be 1514.</p>
</div>
<p>Twyne―“Here lieth the body of Mr. William Twyne, for divers years
fellow of St. John's College, in Cambridge, Batchelor in Divinity, and
Rector of this church, whose exemplary convers­ation in both places,
for solid lear­ning and true piety, deservedly recom­mended him to the
imitation of others. He de­parted this life the last day of January,
1665, and in the 41st yeare of his age.”</p>
<p>Turner—Bryanus Turner, died
Feb. 20th, 1697, and was buried, Feb. 22nd, 1697 Also two of his
sons, 1696―1697</p>
<p>Shaw—“Here lies the body of Jeffery Shaw, B.D., Rector of
this Clurch, who fell down dead while he was reading divine service
therein ou Sunday, Nov, 17th, 1706. ‘Blessed_is that servant whom the
LORD when He cometh shall find so doing.’”</p>
<p>Russel1—“M. T. Reverendi viri Joannis Russell, S. T. B. Divi Joan. Evangel
apud Cantab Socii Deui Nujas Parochiæ Amiros, ultra 36 rectoris, qui
obiit 5 die memsis Martii, ano., salutis,1791 ; ætatis, 84”<br />
“Juxta
jacet, Elizabetha, J. R. uxor, quœ obiit, die 26, m Martii, anno,
salutis, 1791 ; ætatis, 84”</p>
<p>Horseman―“Rev. John Horseman, B.1)., June
25, 1800, aged 73, and, Ursula, wife of the Revd. John Horseman,
Rector of Souldern, died April 19, 1803, aged 65 years”</p>
<p>†Throckmorton—In the chancel is another brass
 consisting of a heart supported by two hands, with three scrolls
 issuing from the heart. The following words are written on the
 scrolls :―“Credo quod Redemter meus vivit et in novissimo die de tra
 surrectur su et in carne mea videbo Deu Salvatore meu.” In­scribed
 upon the heart are the words, “Jhu mcy.”; and below the brass, “Here
 lyeth buryed John Throckmorton the son of Hugh Throckmorton (gent)
 by Elizabeth his wife, who died 6th October, in the year of our Lord,
 1537.” With re­ference to this interesting brass, we have been
 favoured with the copy of a letter from the Rev. Henry Burgess to
 Dr. Rotton, in which it is said that “hearts are usual on brasses
 before the Reformation, and held in hands. They are sometimes
 inscribed with ‘Mercy,’ or ‘Jesu mercy' (as at Souldern). The passage
 from Job xix., 25, 26, is frequently found in connection with the
 heart, the latter being inscribed  “Crelo,” and the scrolls, three in
 number, continuing the text. Sometimes the heart is held by two hands
 issuing from clouds (as at Souldern also). It is said that such
 memorials indicated that the deceased was enabled to perform a vow
 which he had made, but better still, I think they are intended to
 embody the ancient invitatory ‘sursuin corda,’ and to express a firm
 trust in the promises of GOD. I am also told that the heart was often
 interred in a different church from that in which the body was
 buried.”</p>
<p>The attention of the present baronet, Sir Nicholas William
 Throckmorton, having been called in 1881 to the dilapidated state of
 this interesting family memorial, he at once caused it to be
 perfectly restored, The only remaining monument to be noticed is another brass (also in the chancel) being the
 effigy of a girl of apparently 16 or 17 years. This has been recently
 polished and re-placed by the direction, and at the ex­pense of,
 Dr. Rotton. (1882.)</p>

<h3 id="TOC-Church-Register.">Church Register.</h3>
<p>For the present condition of the earliest existing Register, the
Parish is much indebted to Dr. Rotton. It contains—</p>
<p>“Briefs” from A.D. 1668 to Michaelmas, 1771</p>
<p>Baptisms from June 1668 to March 1741</p>
<p>Marriages from Feb. 21, 1668 to April 14, 1741</p>
<p>Burials from September 14, 1669 to June 17, 1742</p>
<p>The Briefs appear principally to have been
directed to the relief of the following—</p>
<p>French and Irish Protestants</p>
<p>The Slaves of Algiers</p>
<p>The Restoration of Cathedrals and Churches</p>
<p>Losses by Fire</p>
<p>Sufferers from Shipwreck</p>
<p>But the French Protestants
seem to have been the favourite objects of charity, for in a brief of
the 2nd May, 1686, we find the sum of £3 3s. 11½d. collected for
them. Whilst on the 27th May, 1706, the brief for the reformed
Episcopal Church in Polish Russia only amounted to 4s. 6d.</p>
<p>The
following is a copy of one of these collections about the year
1732. For Llandaff Cathedral, charge £63,666 and upwards—</p>

<p>Baptisms –In
the list of Baptisms the names of Heritage, Bignoll, Barrett, Rogers,
Hyett, Freeman, East, Bates, Colegrave, Bennett, Gough, Paynton,
Weedon, and Bower, frequently appear, There are two entries, one of
August 9, 1709.
“baptised Montague, son of William Drake, Esq.,” and the other of
April 18th, 1713, “Adria, daughter of William Drake, Esq.” How the
said William Drake was connected with Souldern we do not know.</p>
<p>The
order for burying in woollen appears as follows—“Act for burying in
Woollen, only to be read ye first Sunday after St. Bartholomew every
year for seven years, commencing 1678. Contents of it ar. —</p>
<p>I. That ye minister register all burialls.</p>

<p>IV. If ye Minister, Churchwardens, Overseers, Justices,
neglect their forsd. respective duties, are to forfeit Five Pounds,”
and so on.</p>
<p>Elizabeth Horn, the first buried under these regulations,
September 15, 1678.</p>
<p>There seems to have been a breach of this Act in
the following case—Sarah Gough, virgo, sepult May 29, 1684. “No
affidavit brought on the 6th June to John Dodwell, church­warden,
Soldern, or any shown (?) to Mr. King.”</p>
<p>“This certificate is to inform
yt, no affidavit has been brought to mee within ye titne linnited by
ye Act of Parliament for burying in woollen, concerning Mrs. Sarah
Grough being interred according to ye direction thereof. Witness my
hand this 7th of June, 1684. B. T. (Bryan Turner, rector.)”</p>
<p>In 1685,
we find the entry—“Johannis Horne, adolescens buried according to the
rites of the Anglican Church,“ and this notice occurs again in the
following—</p>
<p>Thomas Lepington, Oct., 1687</p>
<p>Maria Weedon, Nov., 1689</p>
<p>Ricardus Kilby (armiger), 1693</p>
<p>Mortuaries.—A mortuary is defined as a sort of Ecclesiastical
heriot, a customary gift claimed by, and due to the minister of a
parish on the death of a parishiomer. Such claims are allowed and
prov­ided for under the 21st, Henry VIII., c. 6, and have not been
interfered with by the 43rd and 44th Vic., c. 41; but were formerly
claimed and paid at Souldern. See p. 55 of the old Register, where,
under the head “Mortuuries” is written—</p>
<p>Hee or shee yt, deceaseth worth
ten s. d.</p>
<p>marks paies ........................ 3 4</p>
<p>If worth 30 pounds in mouvable goods paies 6 8</p>
<p>If worth 40 pounds in mouvable goods paies 10 0</p>
<p>21st Henry VIII., 6.)</p>
<p>No woman being covert Baron paies
any mortuary; nor child, nor person not keeping house, nor way­faring
person, nor non-resident.</p>
<p>Accordingly, s. d.</p>
<p>Thos. Dodwell for his
sister Isabel paid 3 4</p>
<p>Mrs. Kilby for her husband ... 10 0</p>
<p>John Weedon, for his father ... 10 0</p>
<p>Ferdinando Gough, for his sister, Sarah ... .. 3 4</p>
<p>Mr. Drope, for his father ................... ... ... 10 0</p>
<p>Shreeve Paynton, Esq., for his father, Dodwell 10 0</p>
<p>This Shreeve Paynton's son
Richard seems to have married one of the Dollys, of Souldern, and
their daughter, christened “Dolly,” espoused “Francis Pigott,
impropriator of the church of Banbury, third son of John Pigott, of
Windsor, by Isabella, heiress of Thomas Gillery, a Colonel in the army
of King William” (see monuments in Banbury Church). The only son and
child of the aforesaid Francis and Dolly, “Paynton Pigott," who
afterwards took the names of “Stainsby Conant,” married Lucy, fourth
daughter of Richard Drope Gough, and left a numerous family. His
eldest son, “Francis Pigott Stainsby Conaut was member for Read­ing,
and governor of the Isle of Man.” Another son, “Sir Gillery,” also
member for Read­ing, was Recorder of Hereford and one of the Barons of
Her Majesty's Court of Exchequer.</p>
