<p>This account is taken from the reports of the Commissioners for
enquiring into the charities in the hundreds of Banbury and Bloxham,
also other places in the hundreds of Wooton, Ploughley, Chad­lington,
and Bull­ington, Oxon. Printed and sold by J. G. Rusher, Bridge­street,
Banbury, 1826. By an award―follow­ing
upon a suit in which the plaintiffs were Richard Love (gentleman),
Thomas Norbury (clerk), Richard Gough, John Dodwell, William Dodwell,
John Pearce, John Bignell, Richard Hob­craft, William Bignell, Richard
Bignell, John Hall, Richard Dodwell, John King, William Bower, George
Bower, Robert Wise, John Brown, William Baynard, Simon Bates, and
William Hodgett, freeholders of Souldern—which award was confirmed by
a decree in Chancery, dated 29th June, 10th James I., it is stated
amongst other things, that for the better provision and maintenance of
the poor of the said town of Souldern, the Surveyors, with the consent
and good liking of the lord of the manor, and the principal
landowners, set out to and for the use and behoof of the poor inhabitants
of Souldern aforesaid, a parcel of ground at “Coles Cross,” containing
7 acres, a plot called “The Green,” containing 5 acres, and “The Pits"
and “Bowling Green,” consisting of 1 acre; and it was also directed
with the like consent and agreement, that the incumbent of the said
parish and his successors, should pay yearly in lieu of a piece of
waste ground adjoining the parsonage, to the church­wardens of Souldern
for the time being, for the proper use and behoof of the poor
inhabitants thereof the sum of 5s, every Lady-day. There are no
trustees appointed therein, nor are there any directions as to the
manner in which the property was intended to be used, or as to the
application of the profits. Up to the year 1814 the greater part of
this land was unenclosed, and every villager might turn his horses or
cattle on it as he pleased, and the land was the subject of constant
contention amongst the poor. On the 2nd April, 1814, Robert Kilbye Cox
and Richard Drope Gough, Esqrs., preferred a petition to the Court of
Chancery, setting forth the decree of 29th June, 10th of James I., by
which the award and enclosure were confirmed, and praying that it
might be referred to the Master to appoint proper persons as trustees
of the lands allotted for the benefit of the poor of Souldern, and to
let and receive the rents for the same, and to approve of a scheme for
the application of the rents, and that William
Godfrey and others might be ordered to deliver up to the trustees such
parts of the said lands as were in their possession respectively and
to account for the rents thereof, upon which it was ordered that it
should be referred to the Master, to inquire whether the lands
mentioned in the petition were part of those allotted to the said
poor, and if so, that he should take account of the rents and profits
which the persons in possession had received, and also to appoint
proper persons to be trustees of the said lands, and it was ordered
that the rest of the petition should stand over until the Master
should have made his report. The Master's report, dated 18th March,
1815, was confirmed 25th May following, and Robert Kilbye Cox, Richard
Drope Gough, Willian Ralph Cartwright, John Coker, Esq., John Hill,
and William Minn (gentlenen), the lord of the manor for the time being,
the Rector, church­wardens, and overseers of Souldern, for the time
being were appointed trustees of the said lands, and it was ordered
that the persons whom the Master had found in possession of the said
premises, should deliver up the same to the said trustees, and that
the costs of the petitioners should be paid out of the rents and
profits of the said lands. No order, however, was made with respect to
the future application of the rents and profits.</p>
<p>I. The property above
described consists of the ground at Coles Cross, 7 acres, being arable
land, and about three-quarters of an acre, part of the green, let on
lease, dated 7th May, 1819, to Robert Kilbye Cox, Esq., for 99 years
from the date hereof, at the yearly rent of £1 in consid­era­tion of
£236 7s.6d. This lease was granted upon the terms above-mentioned, the
same being approved by the Master in Chancery, for the purpose of
paying off the debt incurred by the proceedings abovementioned, and
which amounted to that sum. The annual value of the premises was then
estimated at 4:12, but does not now (1826) exceed £9 or £10.</p>
<p>II. Upon
the remaining portions of the green, and the bowling leys there are
(1826) 17 cottages built there partly by the parish and partly by the
poor themselves. Each of these cottages has a small
garden attached to it, and there are 40 gardens be­sides. Every
poor person occupying a house and garden pays yearly to the trustees
1s. 6d., and everyone occupying a garden only the small annual sum of
1s.*</p>
<p>III. The pits and bowling green, containing not more than half an
acre of pasture, were let in 1826 to Henry Essery, as yearly tenant at
a rent of £1 1s., which was fair value. There are roads adjoining this
part of the land, and encroachments have been made since by building
four cottages and fencing out small gardens to them, which, being
in­cluded, would make the whole plot an acre as des­cribed in the
award. (These houses and gardens are included in the number
above-mentioned.)</p>
<p>IV. A parcel of land adjoining the parsonage for
which is is paid yearly.</p>
<p>All the rents arising from these premises
amounting, if the whole were collected, to about £5, are carried to an
account separate from the overseer's book, together with the rent of a
cottage built upon the waste near the turnpike gate, and the feeding
of different lanes in the parish, which are let annually by
auction. These latter, at the time of the report, were held by four
tenants at rents amounting to £1 16s. The sum collected is
dis­tributed, under the directions of the vestry, amongst all the poor
of the parish, none being omitted. Those who have no cottage or
garden, except two or three, who may receive less, have 5s, each,
whilst those who have cottages and gardens are only paid 1s. A small
surplus is always reserved for poor widows or old worn-out men.</p>

<p>Thomas Dodwell, of Souldern, by
indentures of lease and release, dated 17th and 18th August, 1694,
conveyed to Robert Bigmelland John Wat­son, and their heirs, 3½ acres
of meadow grounds lying in the town of Souldern, to the use of himself
for life and after his death to the use of Mary Big­nell, her heirs and
assigns for ever, upon trust that the said Mary Bignell and her heirs
should after his decease pay into the hands of the overseers and
church­wardens for the time being of the parish
of Souldern aforesaid, yearly the sum of 30s. at one entire payment,
on the 24th June, to the intent that the sail churchwardens and
overseers should every year lay out and dispense the said yearly sum
of 30s, and every part thereof in the clothing of two of such of the
poor people, inhabitants of Souldern aforesaid, as the major part of
the landowners of Souldern, being protestants, and having the quantity
of a quarter of a yard land or more within the parish of Souldern,
should, from time to time, nominate and appoint, and to no other use
or purpose whatever. In 1826 the sum of £1 10s. was annually paid by
Mr. John Merry, the owner of the premises charged, and laid out by the
overseers in cloth, which was given at a vestry among five or six poor
and industrious protestants not receiving parish relief. In the years
1824-5 three men and three women received a sufficient quantity of
cloth to make them a jacket or petticoat. The oldest resident
parishioners, being married persons, re­ceive it in
succession.</p>

<p>The same Thos, Dodwell, also by
deed, dated 18th August, 1694, conveyed two closes in this parish,
containing, by estimation, 20 acres, called the “Millsedges” to the
use of Mary, his niece, for life, and after her decease to the use of
John Big­nell, his heirs and assigns, upon trust, that the said Mary
Laxton and ñer assigns, during her life, and the said John Bignell,
his heirs and assigns after her death should weekly on Sunday in the
forenoon distribute in the parish church of Souldern, to four poor
persons, inhabitants of Souldern, to be from time to time nominated by
the major part of the freeholders (these being protestants), and
having the quantity of a quarter of a yard land in Souldern aforesaid,
one three­penny loaf of baker's bread apiece, and if the land­owners
should refuse or neglect to nominate such poor persons, it was directed
that the loaves should delivered by the said Mary Laxton during her
life, and the said John Bignell, his heirs and assigns afterwards, to
any four of the poor pro­testant inhabitants of Souldern, who, in
their
judgment, should most need the same. By deed, dated 12th March,
1699, the above uses were re­voked, and a small close in Souldern,
called “Little Millsedge,” and the two closes above, called “The
Millsedges,” were conveyed to the use of Robert Bignell, his heirs and
assigns upon trust to distri­bute bread to four poor persons, weekly,
as directed in the former deeds. In 1826 the above premises were the
property of William Minn, of Souldern, and he supplied the four
three­penny loaves a week, given at the church on Sunday morning, to
four poor widows of the parish, nominated by the vestry as any
vacancies occurred.</p>
<h3 style="text-indent:0em;text-align:center"><a name="TOC-Cartwright-s-Charity."></a>Cartwright's Charity.</h3>
<p>The sum of £2 3s. 4d. is paid
annually by Wm. Ralph Cartwright, Esq., of Aynho, the proprietor of
land in Souldern. This appears to be part of a rent charge of
£9.19s. 4d., mentioned in the marriage settlement of the said
W. R. Cartwright, dated 8th April, 1784, whereby certain estates in
Aynho, Souldern, Deddington, Clifton and Hempton, were settled, and
which contained in the covenant ainst incumbrances the following
clause, “other than and except a certain annual sum of
£0.19s. 4d. issuing and payable for ever, out of all or some part of
the premises and hereditaments hereby conveyed to the poor of Aynho,
Crowton, and Souldern, for bread, given by the last will of Richard
Cartwright, Esq., deceased” (dated 1st February, 1633. With the sum of
£23s. 4d. five eight­penny loaves are provided, which are given by the
overseers in the church, to five poor widows who are appointed in the
same manner as those who receive Dowlwell's bread.</p>
<h3 style="text-indent:0em;text-align:center"><a name="TOC-Westcar-s-Charity."></a>Westcar's Charity.</h3>
<p>Elizabeth Westcar, of Hill House, in the parish of Souldern, by will
dated 19th February, 1820, gave to John Westcar and William Tubb
certain property therein mentioned upon trust to sell the same, and to
make certain payments thereout, and upon further trust that they, the
said John Westcar and William Tubb, and the survivor of them, his
executor, or administrator, should stand possessed of the residue of
the money to arise from such sale, in trust, for the
purposes thereinafter mentioned, that is
to say, as to the sum of £400, part thereof upon trust, to invest the
same in their own names, or name, in the purchase of stock in the
public funds or upon Government securities at interest, and to ter the
securities as occasion should reuire, and as they should require, and
as they should think expedient; and to pay, apply, and to lay out the
dividends, interest and annual proceeds thereof to arise or be
received by them as follows—one half thereof in the purchase of
clothing, and the other half thereof in the purchase of bread —
to the
use of the poor of Souldern, to be given and distributed yearly, on
Christmas Day, in such proportions and in such manner as the said John
Westcar and Williain Tubb, or the sur­vivor of them, the executor or
admin­ist­rator of such survivor should in their or his dis­cretion think
fit and direct, and, as to the sum of £200 upon trust to invest the
same in like manner with like power to alter the securities, and, to
pay over the dividends and annual pro­ceeds thereof to the schoolmaster
for the time being of the National School at Souldern aforesaid or
otherwise permit and empower him to receive and take the same. These
legacies were laid out by the executors in the purchase of £518
10s. navy five per cents., which is now converted into £544
8s. 6d. four per cents., producing an annual dividend of £21
15s. 6d. he dividends have hitherto been received by the late
Wm. Tubb, of Oxford, and paid by him partly in the purchase of bread,
clothes, and blankets, which he distri­buted himself amongst the poor
of Souldern, and partly to the master of the National School in
Souldern, according to the proportions of the two several legacies
(1826). The actual receipts of the year 1881 from the Souldern
charities, amounted to a little more than £47. The accounts were fully
audited and approved by the Charity Commissioners at
Whitehall.</p>

<p><i>(From the Commissioners' Report of the
Charities at Bicester.) </i></p>
<p>Feoffees' Lands.—By an inquisition taken at
Bicester under a commission of charitable uses, 6th April, 41st
Elizabeth, it was found that there was before that time a feoff­ment
made or an estate in fee sufficiently executed to certain persons and
their heirs of certain lands and tenements with their appurt­enances in
the town and fields of Bicester, Bucknell, Wendlebury, Souldern (near
Woodstock), and Stretton, in the county of Oxford, sometime the
inheritance of one John Wykyns, alias Wiggins. The earliest account we
have of the lands vested in the feoffees subse­quent to the inquisition
is contained in a terrier which purports to have been made in the 45th
year of the reign of Queen Elizabeth, and contains <i>inter alia</i> the
following particulars : Souldern— 15 acres of land in 14 parcels,
lying in different open fields, a piece of ground called — containing 3
acres, or thereabouts. Two little closes called Brown's closes. From
the Commi­ssioners’ Report, 1826, Bicester cottages, with three parcels
of land called the Home Close, la. Or. 16p.; the Barn Ground,
13.a. 1r. 2p.; and the Lower Ground, 13a, 2r. 28p. Part of these
premises are an ancient enclosure, and the remainder was set out by
the award of certain persons who were appointed by agreement among the
landowners to divide and ஃ the commonable fields of Souldern, which
award was confirmed by a decree of the court of Chancery, about the
year, 1613. The allotment is described as containing 26a, 3p,</p>
