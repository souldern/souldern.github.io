<p>TO THE HON. MRS. JOHN BRYAN STAPLETON, WITH SINCERE REGARDS.</p>

<h2 style="text-indent:0em;text-align:center"><a name="TOC-Preface"></a>Preface</h2>
<p> About three years ago, after reading some Papers in the Bicester
Herald, by the late Mr. WING, it struck the Compilers that no one had
attempted any detailed description of the Parish in which they are
particularly interested, and, in order to supply this omission, they
resolved to collect all the information within their reach upon the
subject.</p>
<p>It is scarcely necessary to observe that there is no attempt
whatever at originality in these imperfect notes.</p>
<p>The Authorities
principally consulted are Skelton's Oxfordshire, White Kennett's
Antiquities, Beesley's History of Banbury, Napier's History of
Swincombe and Ewelme, the Oxfordshire Directory (1851), Wing's various
Pamphlets, Brewer's Oxfordshire, Sir Henry Dryden's Pamphlet on
Antiquities discovered at Souldern, Nicholl's Curiosities of
Literature of the 18th Century, Waterlow's History of Cornhill, Stow's
Survey, Hume and Rapin's Histories of England, Turner's Annals of
Oxford, Davenport's Oxfordshire Annals, and the Reports of the Charity
Commissioners.</p>
<p>They are under the greatest obligations to the
following gentlemen, to whom they tender their most sincere thanks:—</p>
<p>To F. Madan, Esq., sub-librarian of the Bodleian, and the
Rev. Dymock Fletcher, for Notes on the early History of the Church and
Manor; also to Mr. Madan, for many valuable suggestions, as well as
for the list of the clergy up to nearly the last appointment prior to
the reign of James I.</p>
<p>To the Rev. J. W. Pieters, sometime Bursar of
St. John's College, Cambridge, for a continuation of that list up to
the present time. To the Rev. Dr. Rotton, for much information and
assistance</p>
<p>
   To George Dolman, Esq., and Col. Cox, for the papers on Souldern
   House, the Roman Catholic Chapel, and Pedigree.
  </p>
<p>To Mr. Tingey,
   schoolmaster, for details respecting the school and the benefit
  society. And to many others for sundry particulars.</p>
<p>Various
   petitions to the High Court of Chancery, papers relating thereto,
   the Parish Register, and some private documents, have also been
   consulted. That this little work contains many errors and
   shortcomings the compilers are fully aware. They can only offer it
   to their friends and neighbours with the advice given by the great
   Mr. Jorrocks to Miserrimus Doleful respecting the old horse—
