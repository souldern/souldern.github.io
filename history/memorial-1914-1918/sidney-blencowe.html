<p>In the 1891 Census he was living in Souldern but moved later to Kings Norton
Sidney and his brother, Austin, migrated to Sydney in 1914 followed by wife Louisa and one son. The family settled in Melbourne and Sidney was a labourer before enlisting
in 1916. He was Killed in action 3 May 1917  (the first day of the second battle of Bullecourt, two weeks of bitter trench fighting which eventually, and at the cost of 2,250 Australian casualties, cleared and held part of the Hindenburg Line.)
From the history of the 23rd “This, toughest of all propositions since Pozières, was tackled on May 3rd, the 6th Brigade forming the centre pivot, with a British Division on our left, and the 5th Brigade on the right flank. It was there the Battalion distinguished itself by its dash and determination to break the famous Siegfried line. The feat was accomplished, and for a time the boys hung on to the position with a tenacity that neither our severe losses, the enemy's artillery or infantry could break. The work of the officers and men throughout was splendid, and the behaviour of the reinforcements, who had joined up the day previous, showed they were made of
good material. To many it was their first and last fight."</p>
